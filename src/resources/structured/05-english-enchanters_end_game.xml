                Being an account of beginnings-and endings.
                Excerpts from The Book of Torak
            </p>
        </title>
        <p>HEAR ME, YE Angaraks, for I am Torak, Lord of Lords and King of Kings. Bow before my Name and worship me
            with prayers and with sacrifices, for I am your God and I have dominion over all the realms of the
            Angaraks. And great shall be my wrath if ye displease me.
        </p>
        <p>I was, before the world was made. I shall be, after the mountains crumble into sand, the seas dwindle to
            stagnant pools, and the world shrivels and is no more. For I was before time and shall be after.
        </p>
        <p>From the timeless reaches of Infinity, I gazed upon the future. And I beheld that there were two
            Destinies and that they must rush toward each other from the endless corridors of Eternity. Each Destiny
            was Absolute, and in that final meeting, all that was divided should be made one. In that instant, all
            that was, all that is, and all that was yet to be should be gathered into one Purpose.
        </p>
        <p>And because of my Vision, I led my six brothers to join hands to make all that is, in fulfillment of the
            needs of the Destinies. Thus we set the moon and the sun in their courses and we brought forth this
            world. We covered the world with forests and grasses and made beasts, fowls, and fishes to fill the
            lands and skies and waters which we had made.
        </p>
        <p>But our Father took no joy in this creation which I had caused to be. He turned his face from our labor
            to contemplate the Absolute. I went alone into the high places of Korim, which are no more, and I cried
            out to him to accept what I had made. But he rejected the work I had caused to be and turned from me.
            Then I hardened my heart against him and went down from that place, fatherless evermore.
        </p>
        <p>Once more I counseled my brothers, and we joined our hands and brought forth man to be the instrument of
            our will. We created man as many peoples. And to each people, we gave a choice to select among us the
            one who should be their God. And the peoples chose from us, save only that no people chose Aldur, who
            was ever contrary and discontented that we would not grant him dominion. Then Aldur withdrew himself
            from among us and sought to entice our servants away from us with enchantments. But few were they who
            accepted him.
        </p>
        <p>The peoples who were mine called themselves the Angaraks. I was well pleased with them and I led them to
            the high places of Korim, which are no more, and to them I revealed the nature of the Purpose for which
            I had caused the world to be.
        </p>
        <p>Then they worshipped me with prayers and offered burnt offerings unto me. And I blessed them, and they
            prospered and grew numerous. In their gratitude they raised up an altar to me and there made sacrifice
            to me of their fairest maidens and a portion of their bravest youths. And I was well pleased with them
            and again I blessed them, so that they prospered above all other men and multiplied exceedingly.
        </p>
        <p>Now the heart of Aldur was filled with envy for the worship that was given to me, and he was driven with
            despite for me. Then did he conspire against me within the secret places of his soul, and he took up a
            stone and breathed life into it, that it might thwart my Purpose. And in that stone he sought to gain
            dominion over me. Thus Cthrag Yaska came to be. And there was eternal enmity sealed within Cthrag Yaska
            against me.
        </p>
        <p>And Aldur sat apart with those whom he called his disciples and plotted how the stone should give him
            dominion.
        </p>
        <p>I saw that the accursed stone had divided Aldur from me and from his other brothers. And I went to Aldur
            and remonstrated with him, begging that he lift the wicked enchantment from the stone and take back the
            life he had breathed into it. This I did that Aldur might no longer be divided from his brothers. Yea, I
            did even weep and abase myself before him.
        </p>
        <p>But already the evil stone had gained possession over the soul of Aldur, and he had hardened his heart
            against me. And I saw then that the stone which Aldur had created would forever hold my brother in
            thralldom. And he spoke slightingly to me and would have driven me forth.
        </p>
        <p>Then for the love I bore him and to save him from the evil course which my Vision revealed, I struck my
            brother Aldur down and took from him the accursed rock. And I bore Cthrag Yaska away to bend my will
            upon it and to still the malice within it and quell the wickedness for which it was created. So it was
            that I took the burden of the thing which Aldur had created upon myself.
        </p>
        <p>Aldur was wroth with me. He went to our brothers and spoke to them falsely against me. And each of them
            came to me and spoke slightingly to me, commanding that I return to Aldur that which had twisted his
            soul and which I had taken to free him from the enchantment of it. But I resisted.
        </p>
        <p>Then they girded for war. The sky was blackened with the smoke of their forges as their peoples beat out
            weapons of iron to spill the blood of my Angaraks upon the ground. When the year turned, their hosts
            marched forth and onto the lands of the Angaraks. And my brothers loomed tall in the forefront of the
            hosts.
        </p>
        <p>Now was I greatly loath to lift my hand against them. Yet I could not permit that they should despoil the
            lands of my people or loose the blood of those who worshipped me. And I knew that from such war between
            my brothers and me could come only evil. In that struggle, the Destinies I had seen might be sent
            against each other before it was time, and the universe be shaken apart in that meeting.
        </p>
        <p>And so I chose that which I feared, but which was less evil than the danger I foresaw. I took up the
            accursed Cthrag Yaska and raised it against the earth itself. And in me lay the Purpose of one Destiny,
            while the Purpose of the other was affixed within the stone Aldur had created. The weight of all that
            was or will be was upon us, and the earth could not bear our weight. Then did her mantle rend asunder
            before me, and the sea rushed in to drown the dry land. Thus were the peoples separated one from the
            other, that they might not come upon each other and their blood be spilled.
        </p>
        <p>But such was the malice which Aldur had wrought within the stone that it smote me with fire as I raised
            it to divide the world and prevent evil bloodshed. Even as I spoke the commands unto it, it burst into
            dreadful fire and smote me. The hand with which I held it was consumed and the eye with which I beheld
            it was blinded. One half of my face was marred by its burning. And I, who had been the fairest among my
            brothers, was now abhorrent to the eyes of all, and I must cover my face with a living mask of steel,
            lest they shun me.
        </p>
        <p>An agony filled me from the evil that was done me, and pain lived within me, which could never be
            quenched until the foul stone could be freed of its evil and could repent of its malice.
        </p>
        <p>But the dark sea stood between my people and those who would come against them, and my enemies fled in
            terror of that which I had done. Yea, even my brothers fled from the world which we had made, for they
            dared no longer come against me. Yet still did they conspire with their followers in spirit form.
        </p>
        <p>Then I bore my people away to the wastelands of Mallorea and there caused them to build a mighty city on
            a sheltered place. They named it Cthol Mishrak, as a remembrance of the suffering I had undergone for
            them. And I concealed their city with a cloud that should ever be above it.
        </p>
        <p>Then I had a cask of iron forged, and in it I bound Cthrag Yaska, that the evil stone should never again
            be free to unleash its power to destroy flesh. For a thousand years and still another thousand years I
            labored, contending with the stone that I might release the curse of malice which Aldur had laid upon
            it. Great were the enchantments and words of power which I cast at the obdurate stone, but still its
            evil fire burned when I came near to it, and I felt its curse lying ever upon the world.
        </p>
        <p>Then Belar, youngest and most rash of my brothers, conspired against me with Aldur, who still bore hatred
            and jealousy within his soul toward me. And Belar spoke in spirit to his uncouth people, the Alorns, and
            set them against me. The spirit of Aldur sent Belgarath, the disciple in whom he had most wholly
            instilled his despite, to join with them. And the foul counsel of Belgarath prevailed upon Cherek, chief
            of the Alorns, and upon his three sons.
        </p>
        <p>By evil sorcery, they passed the barrier of the sea I had caused to be and they came like thieves in the
            night to the city of Cthol Mishrak. By stealth and low cunning, they crept through my tower of iron and
            made their way to the chest that held the evil stone.
        </p>
        <p>The youngest son of Cherek, whom men called Riva Iron-grip, had been so woven about with spells and
            enchantments that he could take up the accursed stone and not perish. And they fled with it to the west.
        </p>
        <p>With the warriors of my people I pursued them, that the curse of Cthrag Yaska not again be loosed upon
            the land. But the one called Riva raised the stone and loosed its evil fire upon my people. Thus the
            thieves escaped, bearing the evil of the stone with them into their lands of the west.
        </p>
        <p>Then I pulled down the mighty city of Cthol Mishrak, that my people must flee from its ruins. And I
            divided the Angaraks into tribes. The Nadraks I set in the north to guard the ways in which the thieves
            had come. The Thulls, broad of back for the bearing of burdens, I set in the middle lands. The Murgos,
            fiercest of my people, I sent to the south. And the most numerous I kept with me in Mallorea, to serve
            me and multiply against a day when I should have need of an army against the west.
        </p>
        <p>Above all these peoples I set the Grolims and instructed them in enchantments and wizardry, that they be
            a priesthood to me and watch over the zeal of all others. And them I instructed to keep my altars
            burning and to be unceasing in their sacrifices to me.
        </p>
        <p>Belgarath, in his wickedness, had sent Riva with the accursed stone to rule an island in the Sea of
            Winds.
        </p>
        <p>And there Belar caused two stars to fall to earth. From these, Riva forged a sword and set Cthrag Yaska
            into its pommel.
        </p>
        <p>And when Riva gripped that sword, the universe shuddered about me, and I cried out, for my Vision had
            opened to me, revealing much that had been hidden before. I saw that Belgarath's sorcerous daughter
            should in time be my bride, and I rejoiced. But I also saw that a Child of Light would descend from
            Riva's loins, and he would be an instrument of that Destiny which opposed that other Destiny which gave
            me my Purpose. Then would come a day when I must wake from some long sleep to face the sword of the
            Child of Light. And upon that day, the two Destinies would clash, with only one victor alive and one
            Destiny thenceforth. But which was not revealed.
        </p>
        <p>Long I pondered this Vision, but no more was revealed. And a thousand years passed, and even more.</p>
        <p>Then I called to me Zedar, a wise and just man who had fled from the malice of Aldur's teachings and had
            come unto me with an offer of service. And I sent him to the court of the Serpent People who dwelt among
            swamps in the west. Their God was Issa, but he was ever lazy and he slept, leaving the people who called
            themselves Ny-Issans to the sole rule of their queen. And to her Zedar did make certain offers, which
            were pleasing to her. And she sent her assassins as emissaries to the court of Riva's descendants. There
            did they slay all of that line, save only one child who chose to drown himself in the sea.
        </p>
        <p>Thus did the Vision err, for what Child of Light can be born when none remain to bear him?</p>
        <p>And thus have I assured that my Purpose shall be served and that the evil of Aldur and his brothers shall
            not destroy the world which I caused to be created.
        </p>
        <p>The Kingdoms of the West which have harkened unto the counsel and beguilements of wicked Gods and evil
            sorcerers will be brought unto the dust. And I will harry those who sought to deny me and confound me
            and multiply their suffering. And they shall be brought low and they shall fall before me, offering
            themselves as a sacrifice upon my altars.
        </p>
        <p>And the time shall come when I have Lordship and dominion over all the earth, and all peoples shall be
            mine.
        </p>
        <p>Hear me, ye peoples, and fear me. Bow down before me and worship me. For I am Torak, forever King of
            Kings, Lord of Lords, and God alone to this world which I have caused to be.
        </p>
        <p>
            #Editor's Note: This version, said to be from the dread Book of Torak, is one of several circulated among the Nadraks.
            Since only the high Grolims were permitted official copies of the work, it is impossible to establish that this version is authentic, though internal evidence suggests that much of it may be.
            A true copy of the complete Book of Torak is believed to be in the library of King Anheg of Cherek, but this was not available for comparison.

    <part number="1">
        <title><p>Gar Og Nadrak</p></title>
        <chapter number="1">
            <p>THERE WAS, GARION decided, something definitely mournful about the sound of mule bells. The mule was not
                a particularly loveable animal to begin with, and there was a subtle difference to his gait that
                imparted a lugubrious note to a bell hung about his neck. The mules were the property of a Drasnian
                merchant named Mulger, a lanky, hard-eyed man in a green doublet, who - for a price - had allowed
                Garion, Silk, and Belgarath to accompany him on his trek into Gar og Nadrak. Mulger's mules were laden
                with trade goods, and Mulger himself seemed to carry a burden of preconceptions and prejudices almost as
                heavy as a fully loaded mule pack. Silk and the worthy merchant had disliked each other at first sight,
                and Silk amused himself by baiting his countryman as they rode eastward across the rolling moors toward
                the jagged peaks that marked the boundary between Drasnia and the land of the Nadraks. Their
                discussions, hovering just on the verge of wrangling, grated on Garion's nerves almost as much as the
                tiresome clanging of the bells on Mulger's mules.
            </p>
            <p>Garion's edginess at this particular time came from a very specific source. He was afraid. There was no
                point in trying to conceal that fact from himself. The cryptic words of the Mrin Codex had been
                explained to him in precise detail. He was riding toward a meeting that had been ordained since the
                beginning of time, and there was absolutely no way he could avoid it. The meeting was the end result of
                not one, but two distinct Prophecies, and even if he could persuade one of them that there had been a
                mistake someplace, the other would drive him to the confrontation without mercy or the slightest
                consideration for his personal feelings.
            </p>
            <p>"I think you're missing the point, Ambar," Mulger was saying to Silk with that kind of acid precision
                some men use when talking to someone they truly despise. "My patriotism or lack of it has nothing to do
                with the matter. The well-being of Drasnia depends on trade, and if you people in the Foreign Service
                keep hiding your activities by posing as merchants, it won't be long before an honest Drasnian isn't
                welcome anywhere." Mulger, with that instinct that seemed inborn in all Drasnians, had instantly
                recognized the fact that Silk was not what he pretended to be.
            </p>
            <p>"Oh, come now, Mulger," Silk replied with an airy condescension, "don't be so naive. Every kingdom in the
                world conceals its intelligence activities in exactly the same way. The Tolnedrans do it; the Murgos do
                it; even the Thulls do it. What do you want me to do - walk around with a sign on my chest reading
                'spy'?"
            </p>
            <p>"Frankly, Ambar, I don't care what you do," Mulger retorted, his lean face hardening. "All I can say is
                that I'm getting very tired of being watched everyplace I go, just because you people can't be trusted."
            </p>
            <p>Silk shrugged with an impudent grin. "It's the way the world is, Mulger. You might as well get used to
                it, because it's not going to change."
            </p>
            <p>Mulger glared at the rat-faced little man helplessly, then turned abruptly and rode back to keep company
                with his mules.
            </p>
            <p>"Aren't you pushing it a little?" Belgarath suggested, lifting his head from the apparent doze in which
                he usually rode. "If you irritate him enough, he'll denounce you to the border guards, and we'll never
                get into Gar og Nadrak."
            </p>
            <p>"Mulger's not going to say a word, old friend," Silk assured him. "If he does, he'll be held for
                investigation, too, and there's not a merchant alive who doesn't have a few things concealed in his
                packs that aren't supposed to be there."
            </p>
            <p>"Why don't you just leave him alone?" Belgarath asked.</p>
            <p>"It gives me something to do," Silk replied with a shrug. "Otherwise I'd have to look at the scenery, and
                eastern Drasnia bores me."
            </p>
            <p>Belgarath grunted sourly, pulled his gray hood up over his head, and settled back into his nap.</p>
            <p>Garion returned to his melancholy thoughts. The gorse bushes which covered the rolling moors had a
                depressing gray-green color to them, and the North Caravan Route wound like a dusty white scar across
                them. The sky had been overcast for nearly two weeks, though there was no hint of moisture in the
                clouds.
            </p>
            <p>They plodded along through a dreary, shadowless world toward the stark mountains looming on the horizon
                ahead.
            </p>
            <p>It was the unfairness of it all that upset Garion the most. He had never asked for any of this. He did
                not want to be a sorcerer. He did not want to be the Rivan King. He was not even sure that he really
                wanted to marry Princess Ce'Nedra - although he was of two minds about that. The little Imperial
                Princess could be -
            </p>
            <p>usually when she wanted something - absolutely adorable. Most of the time, however, she did not want
                anything, and her true nature emerged. If he had consciously sought any of this, he could have accepted
                the duty which lay on him with a certain amount of resignation. He had been given no choice in the
                matter, though, and he found himself wanting to demand of the uncaring sky, "Why me?"
            </p>
            <p>He rode on beside his dozing grandfather with only the murmuring song of the Orb of Aldur for company,
                and even that was a source of irritation. The Orb, which stood on the pommel of the great sword strapped
                to his back, sang to him endlessly with a kind of silly enthusiasm. It might be all ver well for the Orb
                to exult about the meeting with Torak, but it was Garion who was going to have to face the Dragon-God of
                Angarak, and it was Garion who was going to have to do all the bleeding. He felt that the unrelieved
                cheerfulness of the Orb was - all things considered - in very poor taste, to say the least.
            </p>
            <p>The border between Drasnia and Gar og Nadrak straddled the North Caravan Route in a narrow, rocky gap
                where two garrisons, one Drasnian and one Nadrak, faced each other across a simple gate that consisted
                of a single, horizontal pole. By itself, the pole was an insubstantial barrier. Symbolically, however,
                it was more intimidating than the gates of Vo Mimbre or Tol Honeth. On one side of the gate stood the
                West; on

            </p>
            <p>the other, the East. With a single step, one could move from one world into a totally different one, and
                Garion wished with all his being that he did not have to take that step.
            </p>
            <p>As Silk had predicted, Mulger said nothing about his suspicions to either the Drasnian pikemen or the
                leather-clad Nadrak soldiers at the border, and they passed without incident into the mountains of Gar
                og Nadrak. Once it passed the border, the caravan route climbed steeply up a narrow gorge beside a
                swiftly tumbling mountain stream. The rock walls of the gorge were sheer, black, and oppressive. The sky
                overhead narrowed to a dirty gray ribbon, and the clanging mule bells echoed back from the rocks to
                accompany the rush and pounding gurgle of the stream.
            </p>
            <p>Belgarath awoke and looked around, his eyes alert. He gave Silk a quick, sidelong glance that cautioned
                the little man to keep his mouth shut, then cleared his throat. "We want to thank you, worthy Mulger,
                and to wish you good luck in your dealings here."
            </p>
            <p>Mulger looked at the old sorcerer sharply, his eyes questioning. "We'll be leaving you at the head of
                this gorge," Belgarath continued smoothly, his face bland. "Our business is off that way." He gestured
                rather vaguely.
            </p>
            <p>Mulger grunted. "I don't want to know anything about it," he declared.</p>
            <p>"You don't, really," Belgarath assured him. "And please don't take Ambar's remarks too seriously. He has
                a comic turn of mind and he says things he doesn't always mean, because he enjoys irritating people.
                Once you get to know him, he's not quite so bad."
            </p>
            <p>Mulger gave Silk a long, hard look and let it pass without comment. "Good luck in whatever it is you're
                doing," he said grudgingly, forced to say it more out of courtesy than out of any genuine good feeling.
            </p>
            <p>"You and the young man weren't bad traveling companions."</p>
            <p>"We are in your debt, worthy Mulger," Silk added with mocking extravagance. "Your hospitality has been
                exquisite."
            </p>
            <p>Mulger looked directly at Silk again. "I don't really like you, Ambar," he said bluntly. "Why don't we
                just let it go at that?"
            </p>
            <p>"I'm crushed." Silk grinned at him.</p>
            <p>"Let it lie," Belgarath growled.</p>
            <p>"I made every effort to win him over," Silk protested.</p>
            <p>Belgarath turned his back on him.</p>
            <p>"I really did." Silk appealed to Garion, his eyes brimming with mock sincerity.</p>
            <p>"I don't believe you either," Garion told him.</p>
            <p>Silk sighed. "Nobody understands me," he complained. Then he laughed and rode on up the gorge, whistling
                happily to himself.
            </p>
            <p>At the head of the gorge, they left Mulger and struck off to the left of the caravan route through a
                jumble of rock and stunted trees. At the crest of a stony ridge, they stopped to watch the slow progress
                of the mules until they were out of sight.
            </p>
            <p>"Where are we headed?" Silk asked, squinting up at the clouds scudding past overhead. "I thought we were
                going to Yar Gurak."
            </p>
            <p>"We are," Belgarath replied, scratching at his beard, "but we'll circle around and come at the town from
                the other side. Mulger's opinions make traveling with him just a bit chancy. He might let something slip
                at the wrong time. Besides, Garion and I have something to take care of before we get there." The old
                man looked around. "Over there ought to do," he said, pointing at a shallow green dale, concealed on the
                far side of the ridge. He led them down into the dale and dismounted.
            </p>
            <p>Silk, leading their single packhorse, pulled up beside a small pool of spring water and tied the horses
                to a dead snag standing at its edge.
            </p>
            <p>"What is it that we have to do, Grandfather?" Garion asked, sliding out of his saddle.</p>
            <p>"That sword of yours is a trifle obvious," the old man told him. "Unless we want to spend the whole trip
                answering questions, we're going to have to do something about it."
            </p>
            <p>"Are you going to make it invisible?" Silk asked hopefully.</p>
            <p>"In a manner of speaking," Belgarath answered. "Open your mind to the Orb, Garion. Just let it talk to
                you."
            </p>
            <p>Garion frowned. "I don't understand."</p>
            <p>"Just relax. The Orb will do the rest. It's very excited about you, so don't pay too much attention to it
                if it starts making suggestions. It has a severely limited understanding of the real world. Just relax
                and let your mind sort of drift. I've got to talk to it, and I can only do that through you. It won't
                listen to anybody else."
            </p>
            <p>Garion leaned back against a tree; in a moment he found his mind filled with all manner of peculiar
                images.
            </p>
            <p>The world he perceived in that imagining was tinged over with a faint blue haze, and everything seemed
                angular, as if constructed out of the flat planes and sharp edges of a crystal. He caught a vivid
                picture of himself, flaming sword in hand, riding at great speed with whole hordes of faceless men
                fleeing out of his path. Belgarath's voice sounded sharply in his mind then. "Stop that." The words, he
                realized, were not directed at him, but instead at the Orb itself. Then the old man's voice dropped to a
                murmur, instructing, explaining something. The responses of that other, crystalline awareness seemed a
                trifle petulant; but eventually there seemed to be an agreement of some kind, and then Garion's mind
                cleared.
            </p>
            <p>Belgarath was shaking his head with a rueful expression. "It's almost like talking to a child sometimes,"
                he said. "It has no conception of numbers, and it can't even begin to comprehend the meaning of the word
                danger."
            </p>
            <p>"It's still there," Silk noted, sounding a bit disappointed. "I can still see the sword."</p>
            <p>"That's because you know it's there," Belgarath told him. "Other people will overlook it."</p>
            <p>"How can you overlook something that big?" Silk objected.</p>
            <p>"It's very complicated," Belgarath replied. "The Orb is simply going to encourage people not to see it -
                or the sword. If they look very closely, they might realize that Garion's carrying something on his
                back, but they won't be curious enough about it to try to find out what it is. As a matter of fact,
                quite a few people won't even notice Garion himself."
            </p>
            <p>"Are you trying to say that Garion's invisible?"</p>
            <p>"No. He's just sort of unremarkable for the time being. Let's move on. Night comes on quickly up in these
                mountains."
            </p>
            <p>Yar Gurak was perhaps the ugliest town Garion had ever seen. It was strung out on either side of a
                roiling yellow creek, and muddy, unpaved streets ran up the steep slopes of the cut the stream had
                gouged out of the hills. The sides of the cut beyond the town had been stripped of all vegetation. There
                were shafts running back into the hillsides, and great, rooted-out excavations. There were springs among
                the diggings, and they trickled muddy water down the slopes to pollute the creek. The town had a
                slapdash quality about it, and all the buildings seemed somewhat temporary. Construction was, for the
                most part, log and uncut rock, and several of the houses had been finished off with canvas.
            </p>
            <p>The streets teemed with lanky, dark-faced Nadraks, many of whom were obviously drunk. A nasty brawl
                erupted out of a tavern door as they entered the town, and they were forced to stop while perhaps two
                dozen Nadraks rolled about in the mud, trying with a fair amount of success to incapacitate or even maim
                each other.
            </p>
            <p>The sun was going down as they found an inn at the end of a muddy street. It was a large, square building
                with the main floor constructed of stone, a second storey built of logs, and stables attached to the
                rear. They put up their horses, took a room for the night, and then entered the barnlike common room in
                search of supper. The benches in the common room were a bit unsteady, and the tabletops were grease.
                smeared and littered with crumbs and spilled food. Oil lamps hung smoking on chains, and the smell of
                cooking cabbage was overpowering. A fair number of merchants from various parts of the world sat at
                their evening meal in the room - wary-eyed men in tight little groups, with walls of suspicion drawn
                around them.
            </p>
            <p>Belgarath, Silk, and Garion sat down at an unoccupied table and ate the stew brought to them in wooden
                bowls by a tipsy servingman in a greasy apron. When they had finished, Silk glanced at the open doorway
                leading into the noisy taproom and then looked inquiringly at Belgarath.
            </p>
            <p>The old man shook his head. "Better not," he said. "Nadraks are a high-strung people, and relations with
                the West are a little tense just now. There's no point in asking for trouble."
            </p>
            <p>Silk nodded his glum agreement and led the way up the stairs at the back of the inn to the room they had
                taken for the night. Garion held up their guttering candle and looked dubiously at the log-frame bunks
                standing against the walls of the room. The bunks had rope springs and mattresses stuffed with straw;
                they looked lumpy and not very clean. The noise from the taproom below was loud and raucous.
            </p>
            <p>"I don't think we're going to get much sleep tonight," he observed. "Mining towns aren't like farm
                villages,"
            </p>
            <p>Silk pointed out. "Farmers feel the need for decorum - even when they're drunk. Miners tend on the whole
                to be somewhat rowdier."
            </p>
            <p>Belgarath shrugged. "They'll quiet down in a bit. Most of them will be unconscious long before
                midnight."
            </p>
            <p>He turned to Silk. "As soon as the shops open up in the morning, I want you to get us some different
                clothing - used, preferably. If we look like gold hunters, nobody's going to pay very much attention to
                us.
            </p>
            <p>Get a pick handle and a couple of rock hammers. We'll tie them to the outside of the pack on our spare
                horse for show."
            </p>
            <p>"I get the feeling you've done this before."</p>
            <p>"From time to time. It's a useful disguise. Gold hunters are crazy to begin with, so people aren't
                surprised if they show up in strange places." The old man laughed shortly. "I even found gold once - a
                vein as thick as your arm."
            </p>
            <p>Silk's face grew immediately intent. "Where?"</p>
            <p>Belgarath shrugged. "Off that way somewhere," he replied with a vague gesture. "I forget exactly."</p>
            <p>"Belgarath," Silk objected with a note of anguish in his voice.</p>
            <p>"Don't get sidetracked," Belgarath told him. "Let's get some sleep. I want to be out of here as early as
                possible tomorrow morning."
            </p>
            <p>The overcast which had lingered for weeks cleared off during the night; when Garion awoke, the new-risen
                sun streamed golden through the dirty window. Belgarath was seated at the rough table on the far side of
                the room, studying a parchment map, and Silk had already left.
            </p>
            <p>"I thought for a while that you were going to sleep past noon," the old man said as Garion sat up and
                stretched.
            </p>
            <p>"I had trouble getting to sleep last night," Garion replied. "It was a little noisy downstairs."</p>
            <p>"Nadraks are like that."</p>
            <p>A sudden thought occurred to Garion. "What do you think Aunt Pol is doing just now?" he asked.</p>
            <p>"Sleeping, probably."</p>
            <p>"Not this late."</p>
            <p>"It's much earlier where she is."</p>
            <p>"I don't follow that."</p>
            <p>"Riva's fifteen hundred leagues west of here," Belgarath explained. "The sun won't get that far for
                several hours yet."
            </p>
            <p>Garion blinked. "I hadn't thought of that," he admitted.</p>
            <p>"I didn't think you had."</p>
            <p>The door opened, and Silk came in, carrying several bundles and wearing an outraged expression. He threw
                his bundles down and stamped to the window, muttering curses under his breath.
            </p>
            <p>"What's got you so worked up?" Belgarath asked mildly.</p>
            <p>"Would you look at this?" Silk waved a piece of parchment at the old man.</p>
            <p>"What's the problem?" Belgarath took the parchment and read it. "That whole business was settled years
                ago," Silk declared in an irntated voice. "What are these things doing, still being circulated?"
            </p>
            <p>"The description is colorful," Belgarath noted.</p>
            <p>"Did you see that?" Silk sounded mortally offended. He turned to Garion. "Do I look like a weasel to
                you?"
            </p>
            <p>"-an ill-favored, weasel-faced man," Belgarath read, "shifty-eyed and with a long, pointed nose. A
                notorious cheat at dice."
            </p>
            <p>"Do you mind?"</p>
            <p>"What's this all about?" Garion asked.</p>
            <p>"I had a slight misunderstanding with the authorities some years ago," Silk explained deprecatingly.</p>
            <p>"Nothing all that serious, actually, but they're still circulating that thing." He gestured angrily at
                the parchment Belgarath was still reading with an amused expression. "They've even gone so far as to
                offer a reward. " He considered for a moment. "I'll have to admit that the sum is flattering, though,"
                he added.
            </p>
            <p>"Did you get the things I sent you after?" Belgarath asked.</p>
            <p>"Of course."</p>
            <p>"Let's change clothes, then, and leave before your unexpected celebrity attracts a crowd."</p>
            <p>The worn Nadrak clothing was made mostly of leather-snug black trousers, tight-fitting vests, and
                short-sleeved linen tunics.
            </p>
            <p>"I didn't bother with the boots," Silk said. "Nadrak boots are pretty uncomfortable - probably since it
                hasn't occurred to them yet that there's a difference between the right foot and the left." He settled a
                pointed felt cap at a jaunty angle. "What do you think?" he asked, striking a pose.
            </p>
            <p>"Doesn't look at all like a weasel, does he?" Belgarath asked Garion. Silk gave him a disgusted look, but
                said nothing.
            </p>
            <p>They went downstairs, led their horses out of the stables attached to the inn, and mounted. Silk's
                expression remained sour as they rode out of Yar Gurak. When they reached the top of a hill to the north
                of town, he slid off his horse, picked up a rock, and threw it rather savagely at the buildings
                clustered below.
            </p>
            <p>"Make you feel better?" Belgarath asked curiously.</p>
            <p>Silk remounted with a disdainful sniff and led the way down the other side of the hill.</p>
        </chapter>
        <chapter number="2">
            <p>THEY RODE FOR the next few days through a wilderness of stone and stunted trees. The sun grew warmer each
                day, and the sky overhead was intensely blue as they pressed deeper and deeper into the snowcapped
                mountains. There were trails of sorts up here, winding, vagrant tracks meandering between the dazzling
                white peaks and across the high, pale green meadows where wildflowers nodded in the mountain breeze. The
                air was spiced with the resinous odor of evergreens, and now and then they saw deer grazing or stopping
                to watch them with large, startled eyes as they passed.
            </p>
            <p>Belgarath moved confidently in a generally eastward course and he appeared to be alert and watchful.</p>
            <p>There were no signs of the half doze in which he customarily rode on more clearly defined roads, and he
                seemed somehow younger up here in the mountains.
            </p>
            <p>They encountered other travelers - leather-clad Nadraks for the most part - although they did see a party
                of Drasnians laboring up a steep slope and, once, a long way off, what appeared to be a Tolnedran. Their
            </p>
            <p>exchanges with these others were brief and wary. The mountains of Gar og Nadrak were at best sketchily
                policed, and it was necessary for every man who entered them to provide for his own security.
            </p>
            <p>The sole exception to this suspicious taciturnity was a garrulous old gold hunter mounted on a donkey,
                who appeared out of the blue-tinged shadows under the trees one morning. His tangled hair was white, and
                his clothing was mismatched, appearing to consist mostly of castoffs he had found beside this trail or
                that. His tanned, wrinkled face was weathered like a well-cured old hide, and his blue eyes twinkled
                merrily. He joined them without any greeting or hint of uncertainty as to his welcome and began talking
                immediately as if taking up a conversation again that had only recently been interrupted.
            </p>
            <p>There was a sort of comic turn to his voice and manner that Garion found immediately engaging.</p>
            <p>"Must be ten years or more since I've followed this path," he began, jouncing along on his donkey as he
                fell in beside Garion. "I don't come down into this part of the mountains very much any more. The
                streambeds down here have all been worked over a hundred times at least. Which way are you bound?"
            </p>
            <p>"I'm not really sure," Garion replied cautiously. "I've never been up here before, so I'm just following
                along."
            </p>
            <p>"You'd find better gravel if you struck out to the north," the man on the donkey advised, "up near
                Morindland. Of course, you've got to be careful up there, but, like they say, no risk, no profit." He
                squinted curiously at Garion. "You're not a Nadrak, are you?"
            </p>
            <p>"Sendar," Garion responded shortly.</p>
            <p>"Never been to Sendaria," the old gold hunter mused. "Never been anyplace really - except up here." He
                looked around at the whitetopped peaks and deep green forests with a sort of abiding love. "Never really
                wanted to go anyplace else. I've picked these mountains over from end to end for seventy years now and
                never made much at it except for the pleasure of being here. Found a river bar one time, though, that
                had so much red gold in it that it looked like it was bleeding. Winter caught me up there, and I almost
                froze to death trying to come out."
            </p>
            <p>"Did you go back the next spring?" Garion couldn't help asking. "Meant to, but I did a lot of drinking
                that winter - I had gold enough. Anyway, the drink sort of addled my brains. When I set out the
                following year, I took along a few kegs for company. That's always a mistake. The drink takes you harder
                when you get up into the mountains, and you don't always pay attention to things the way you should." He
                leaned back in his donkey saddle, scratching reflectively at his stomach. "I went out onto the plains
                north of the mountains -
            </p>
            <p>up in Morindland. Seems that I thought at the time that the going might be easier out on flat ground.
                Well, to make it short, I ran across a band of Morindim and they took me prisoner. I'd been up to my
                ears in an ale keg for a day or so, and I was far gone when they took me. Lucky, I guess. Morindim are
                superstitious, and they thought I was possessed. That's probably all that saved my life. They kept me
                for five or six years, trying to puzzle out the meaning behind my ravings - once I got sober and saw the
                situation, I took quite a bit of care to do a lot of raving. Eventually they got tired of it and weren't
                so careful about watching me, so I escaped. By then I'd sort of forgotten exactly where that river was.
                I look for it now and then when I'm up that way." His speech seemed rambling, but his old blue eyes were
                very penetrating. "That's a big sword you're carrying, boy, Who do you plan to kill with it?"
            </p>
            <p>The question came so fast that Garion did not even have time to be startled.</p>
            <p>"Funny thing about that sword of yours," the shabby old man added shrewdly. "It seems to be going out of
                its way to make itself inconspicuous." Then he turned to Belgarath, who was looking at him with a level
                gaze. "You haven't hardly changed at all," he noted.
            </p>
            <p>"And you still talk too much," Belgarath replied.</p>
            <p>"I get hungry for talk every few years," the old man on the donkey admitted. "Is your daughter well?"</p>
            <p>Belgarath nodded.</p>
            <p>"Fine-looking woman, your daughter - bad-tempered, though."</p>
            <p>"That hasn't changed noticeably."</p>
            <p>"Didn't imagine it had." The old gold hunter chuckled, then hesitated for a moment. "If you don't mind
                some advice, be careful in case you plan to go down into the low country," he said seriously. "It looks
                like things might be coming to a boil down there. A lot of strangers in red tunics are roaming about,
                and there's been smoke coming up from old altars that haven't been used for years. The Grolims are out
                again, and their knives are all new-sharpened. The Nadraks who come up here keep looking back over their
                shoulders." He paused, looking directly at Belgarath. "There've been some other signs, too," he added.
                "The animals are all jumpy - like just before a big storm - and sometimes at night, if you listen close,
                there's something like thunder way off in the distance - like maybe from as far off as Mallorea. The
                whole world seems to be uneasy. I've got a hunch that something pretty big's about to happen - maybe the
                sort of thing you'd be involved in. The point is that they know you're out here. I wouldn't count too
                much on being able to slip through without somebody noticing you." He shrugged then, as if washing his
                hands of the matter. "I just thought you'd like to know."
            </p>
            <p>"Thank you," Belgarath replied.</p>
            <p>"Didn't cost me anything to say it." The old man shrugged again. "I think I'll go that way." He pointed
                off to the north. "Too many strangers coming into the mountains in the last few months. It's starting to
                get crowded. I've about talked myself out now, so I think I'll go look myself up a bit of privacy." He
                turned his donkey and trotted off. "Good luck," he threw back over his shoulder by way of farewell and
                then he disappeared into the blue shadows under the trees.
            </p>
            <p>"You're acquainted with him, I take it," Silk observed to Belgarath.</p>
            <p>The old sorcerer nodded. "I met him about thirty years ago. Polgara had come to Gar og Nadrak to find out
                a few things. After she'd gathered all the information she wanted, she sent word to me, and I came here
                and bought her from the man who owned her. We started home, but an early snowstorm caught us up here in
                the mountains. He found us floundering along, and he took us to the cave where he holes up when the snow
                gets too deep. Quite a comfortable cave really - except that he insists on bringing his donkey inside.
                He and Pol argued about that all winter, as I recall."
            </p>
            <p>"What's his name?" Silk asked curiously.</p>
            <p>Belgarath shrugged. "He never said, and it's not polite to ask."</p>
            <p>Garion, however, had choked on the word "bought." A kind of helpless outrage welled up in him.</p>
            <p>"Somebody owned Aunt Pol?" he demanded incredulously.</p>
            <p>"It's a Nadrak custom," Silk explained. "In their society, women are considered property. It's not seemly
                for a woman to go about without an owner."
            </p>
            <p>"She was a slave?" Garion's knuckles grew white as he clenched his fists.</p>
            <p>"Of course she wasn't a slave," Belgarath told him. "Can you even remotely imagine your Aunt submitting
                to that sort of thing?"
            </p>
            <p>"But you said-"</p>
            <p>"I said I bought her from the man who owned her. Their relationship was a formality - nothing more. She
                needed an owner in order to function here, and he gained a great deal of respect from other men as a
                result of his ownership of so remarkable a woman." Belgarath made a sour face. "It cost me a fortune to
                buy her back from him. I sometimes wonder if she was really worth it."
            </p>
            <p>"Grandfather! "</p>
            <p>"I'm sure she'd be fascinated by that last observation, old friend," Silk said slyly.</p>
            <p>"I don't know that it's necessary to repeat it to her, Silk."</p>
            <p>"You never know." Silk laughed. "I might need something from you someday."</p>
            <p>"That's disgusting."</p>
            <p>"I know." Silk grinned and looked around. "Your friend took quite a bit of trouble to look you up," he
                suggested. "What was behind it?"
            </p>
            <p>"He wanted to warn me."</p>
            <p>"That things were tense in Gar og Nadrak? We knew that already."</p>
            <p>"His warning was a great deal more urgent than that."</p>
            <p>"He didn't sound very urgent."</p>
            <p>"That's because you don't know him."</p>
            <p>"Grandfather," Garion said suddenly, "how did he manage to see my sword? I thought we'd taken care of
                that."
            </p>
            <p>"He sees everything, Garion. He could glance once at a tree and tell you ten years later exactly how many
                leaves were on it."
            </p>
            <p>"Is he a sorcerer?"</p>
            <p>"Not as far as I know. He's just a strange old man who likes the mountains. He doesn't know what's going
                on because he doesn't want to know. If he really wanted to, he could probably find out everything that's
                happening in the world."
            </p>
            <p>"He could make a fortune as a spy, then," Silk mused.</p>
            <p>"He doesn't want a fortune. Isn't that obvious? Any time he needs money, he just goes back to that river
                bar he mentioned."
            </p>
            <p>"But he said he'd forgotten how to find it," Garion protested.</p>
            <p>Belgarath snorted. "He's never forgotten anything in his life." Then his eyes grew distant. "There are a
                few people like him in the world - people who have no interest whatsoever in what other people are
                doing.
            </p>
            <p>Maybe that's not such a bad trait. If I had my life to live over, I might not mind doing it his way." He
                looked around then, his eyes very alert. "Let's take that path over there," he suggested, pointing at a
                scarcely visible track angling off across an open meadow, littered with bits of log bleached white by
                sun and weather. "If what he says is true, I think we'll want to avoid any large settlements. That path
                comes out farther north where there aren't so many people."
            </p>
            <p>Not long afterward the terrain began to slope downward, and the three of them moved along briskly, riding
                down out of the mountains toward the vastness of the forest of Nadrak. The peaks around them subsided
                into forested foothills. Once they topped a rise, they were able to look out at the ocean of trees lying
                below.
            </p>
            <p>The forest stretched to the horizon and beyond, dark green beneath a blue sky. A faint breeze was
                blowing, and the sigh of its passage through the mile upon mile of trees below had a kind of endless
                sadness to it, a regretful memory of summers past and springs that would never come again.
            </p>
            <p>Some distance up the slope from the forest stood a village, huddled at the side of a vast, open pit that
                had been gouged, raw and ugly, in the red dirt of the hillside.
            </p>
            <p>"A mine town," Belgarath noted. "Let's nose about a bit and see what's going on."</p>
            <p>They rode warily down the hill. As they drew closer, Garion could see that the village had that same
                temporary kind of appearance he had noticed about Yar Gurak. The buildings were constructed in the same
                way - unpeeled logs and rough stone - and the low-pitched roofs had large rocks laid on them to keep the
                shingles from blowing off during the winter blizzards. Nadraks seemed not to be concerned about the
                external appearance of their structures; once the walls and roofs were completed, they appeared quite
                content to move in and devote their attentions to other matters, without attending to those final
                finishing touches which gave a house that look of permanence that a Sendar or a Tolnedran would feel
                absolutely necessary. The entire settlement seemed to reflect an attitude of "good enough" that offended
                Garion, for some reason.
            </p>
            <p>Some of the miners who lived in the village came out into the dirt streets to watch the strangers ride
                in.
            </p>
            <p>Their black leather clothing was stained red by the earth in which they dug, and their eyes were hard and
                suspicious. An air of fearful wariness hung over the whole place, seasoned with a touch of defiant
                bellicosity.
            </p>
            <p>Silk jerked his head toward a large, low building with a crude painting of a cluster of grapes on a sign
                banging in the breeze by the double doors at the front. A wide, roofed porch surrounded the building,
                and leather-garbed Nadraks lounged on benches along the porch, watching a dogfight in progress out in
                the middle of the street.
            </p>
            <p>Belgarath nodded. "But let's go around to the side," he suggested, "in case we have to leave in a
                hurry."
            </p>
            <p>They dismounted at the side porch, tied their horses to the railing, and went inside.</p>
            <p>The interior of the tavern was smoky and dim, since windows seemed to be a rare feature in Nadrak
                buildings. The tables and benches were rough-hewn, and what light there was came from smoking oil lamps
                that hung on chains from the rafters. The floor was mud-stained and littered with bits of food. Dogs
                roamed at will under the tables and benches. The smell of stale beer and unwashed bodies hung heavy in
                the air, and, though it was only early afternoon, the place was crowded. Many of the men in the large
                room were already far gone with drink. It was noisy, since the Nadraks lounging at the tables or
                stumbling about the room seemed all habitually to speak at the top of their voices.
            </p>
            <p>Belgarath pushed his way toward a table in the corner where a solitary man sat bleary-eyed and
                slack-lipped, staring into his ale cup. "You don't mind if we share the table, do you?" the old man
                demanded of him in an abrupt manner, sitting down without awaiting a reply.
            </p>
            <p>"Would it do any good if I did?" the man with the cup asked. He was unshaven, and his eyes were pouchy
                and bloodshot.
            </p>
            <p>"Not much," Belgarath told him bluntly.</p>
            <p>"You're new here, aren't you?" The Nadrak looked at the three of them with only a hint of curiosity,
                trying with some difficulty to focus his eyes.
            </p>
            <p>"I don't really see that it's any of your business," Belgarath retorted rudely.</p>
            <p>"You've got a sour mouth for a man past his prime," the Nadrak suggested, flexing his fingers
                ominously.
            </p>
            <p>"I came here to drink, not fight," Silk declared in a harsh tone. "I might change my mind later, but
                right now, I'm thirsty." He reached out and caught the arm of a passing servingman. "Ale," he ordered.
                "And don't take all day."
            </p>
            <p>"Keep your hands to yourself," the servingman told him. "Are you with him?" He pointed at the Nadrak they
                had joined.
            </p>
            <p>"We're sitting with him, aren't we?"</p>
            <p>"You want three cups or four?"</p>
            <p>"I want one-for now. Bring the others what they want, too. I'll pay for the first time around."</p>
            <p>The servingman grunted sourly and pushed his way off through the crowd, pausing long enough to kick a dog
                out of his way.
            </p>
            <p>Silk's offer seemed to quiet their Nadrak companion's belligerence. "You've picked a bad time to come to
                town," he told them. "The whole region's crawling with Mallorean recruiters."
            </p>
            <p>"We've been up in the mountains," Belgarath said. "We'll probably go back in a day or so. Whatever's
                happening down here doesn't interest us very much."
            </p>
            <p>"You'd better take an interest while you're here - unless you'd like to try army life."</p>
            <p>"Is there a war someplace?" Silk asked him.</p>
            <p>"Likely to beer so they say. Someplace down in Mishrak ac Thull."</p>
            <p>Silk snorted. "I've never met a Thull worth fighting."</p>
            <p>"It's not the Thulls. It's supposed to be the Alorns. They've got a queen - if you can imagine such a
                thing -
            </p>
            <p>and she's moving to invade the Thulls."</p>
            <p>"A queen?" Silk scoffed. "Can't be much of an army, then. Let the Thulls fight her themselves."</p>
            <p>"Tell that to the Mallorean recruiters," the Nadrak suggested.</p>
            <p>"Did you have to brew that ale?" Silk demanded of the servingman, who was returning with four large
                cups.
            </p>
            <p>"There are other taverns, friend," the servingman replied. "If you don't like this one, go find another.
                That'll be twelve pennies."
            </p>
            <p>"Three pennies a cup?" Silk exclaimed.</p>
            <p>"Times are hard."</p>
            <p>Grumbling, Silk paid him.</p>
            <p>"Thanks," the Nadrak they were sitting with said, taking one of the cups.</p>
            <p>"Don't mention it," Silk said sourly.</p>
            <p>"What are the Malloreans doing here?" Belgarath asked.</p>
            <p>"Rounding up everyone who can stand up, see lightning, and hear thunder. They do their recruiting with
                leg-irons, so it's a little hard to refuse. They've got Grolims with them too, and the Grolims keep
                their gutting knives out in plain sight as a sort of a hint about what might happen to anybody who
                objects too much."
            </p>
            <p>"Maybe you were right when you said we picked a bad time to come down out of the mountains," Silk said.
            </p>
            <p>The Nadrak nodded. "The Grolims say that Torak's stirring in his sleep."</p>
            <p>"That's not very good news," Silk replied.</p>
            <p>"I think we could all drink to that." The Nadrak lifted his ale cup. "You find anything worth digging for
                up there in the mountains?"
            </p>
            <p>Silk shook his head. "A few traces is all. We've been working the streambeds for free gold. We don't have
                the equipment to drive shafts back into the rock."
            </p>
            <p>"You'll never get rich squatting beside a creek and sifting gravel."</p>
            <p>"We get by." Silk shrugged. "Someday maybe we'll hit a good pocket and we'll be able to pick up enough to
                buy some equipment."
            </p>
            <p>"And someday maybe it will rain beer, too."</p>
            <p>Silk laughed.</p>
            <p>"You ever thought about taking in another partner?"</p>
            <p>Silk squinted at the unshaven Nadrak. "Have you been up there before?" he asked.</p>
            <p>The Nadrak nodded. "Often enough to know that I don't like it - but I think I'd like a stint in the army
                a lot less."
            </p>
            <p>"Let's have another drink and talk about it," Silk suggested.</p>
            <p>Garion leaned back, putting his shoulders against the rough log wall. Nadraks didn't seem to be so bad,
                once you got past the crudity of their nature, They were a blunt-spoken people and a bit sour-faced, but
                they did not seem to have that icy animosity toward outsiders he had noted among the Murgos.
            </p>
            <p>He let his mind drift back to what the Nadrak had said about a queen. He quickly dismissed the notion
                that any of the queens staying at Riva might, under any circumstances, have assumed such authority. That
                left only Aunt Pol. The Nadrak's information could have been garbled a bit; but in Belgarath's absence,
                Aunt Pol might have taken charge of things - although that was not like her, at all. What could possibly
                have happened back there to force her to go to such extremes?
            </p>
            <p>As the afternoon wore on, more and more of the men in the tavern grew reeling drunk, and occasional
                fights broke out - although the fights usually consisted of shoving matches, since few in the room were
                sober enough to aim a good blow. Their companion drank steadily and eventually laid his head down on his
                arms and began to snore.
            </p>
            <p>"I think we've got just about everything we can use here," Belgarath suggested quietly. "Let's drift on
                out.
            </p>
            <p>From what our friend here says, I don't think it'd be a good idea to sleep in town."</p>
            <p>Silk nodded his agreement, and the three of them rose from the table and made their way through the crowd
                to the side door.
            </p>
            <p>"Did you want to pick up any supplies?" the little man asked.</p>
            <p>Belgarath shook his head. "I have a feeling that we want to get out of here as soon as possible."</p>
            <p>Silk gave him a quick look, and the three of them untied their horses, mounted and rode back out into the
                red dirt street. They moved at a walk to avoid arousing suspicion, but Garion could feel a sort of tense
                urgency to put this raw, mud-smeared village behind them. There was something threatening in the air,
                and the golden late afternoon sun seemed somehow shadowed, as if by an unseen cloud. As they were
                passing the last rickety house on the downhill edge of the village, they heard an alarmed shout from
                somewhere back near the center of town. Garion turned quickly and saw a party of perhaps twenty mounted
                men in red tunics plunging at a full gallop toward the tavern the three of them had just left. With a
                practiced skill, the scarlet-clad strangers swung down from their horses and immediately covered all the
                doors to cut off an escape for those inside.
            </p>
            <p>"Malloreans!" Belgarath snapped. "Make for the trees!" And he drove his heels into his horse's flanks.
            </p>
            <p>They galloped across the weedy, stump-cluttered clearing that surrounded the village, toward the edge of
                the forest and safety, but there was no outcry or pursuit. The tavern appeared to contain enough fish to
                fill the Mallorean net. From a safe vantage point beneath spreading tree limbs, Garion, Silk, and
                Belgarath watched as a disconsolate-looking string of Nadraks, chained together at the ankle, were led
                out of the tavern into the red dust of the street to stand under the watchful eyes of the Mallorean
                recruiters.
            </p>
            <p>"It looks like our friend has joined the army, after all," Silk observed.</p>
            <p>"Better him than us," Belgarath replied. "We might be just a little out of place in the middle of an
                Angarak horde." He squinted at the ruddy disk of the setting sun. "Let's move out. We've got a few hours
                before dark. It looks as if military service might be contagious in this vicinity, and I wouldn't want
                to catch it."
            </p>
        </chapter>
        <chapter number="3">
            <p>THE FOREST OF Nadrak was unlike the Arendish forest lying far to the south. The differences were subtle,
                and it took Garion several days to put his finger on them. For one thing, the trails they followed had
                no sense of permanence about them. They were so infrequently traveled that they were not beaten into the
                loamy soil of the forest floor. In the Arendish forest, the marks of man were everywhere, but here man
                was an intruder, merely passing through. Moreover, the forest in Arendia had definite boundaries, but
                this ocean of trees went on to the farthest edge of the continent, and it had stood so since the
                beginning of the world.
            </p>
            <p>The forest teemed with life. Tawny deer flickered among the trees, and vast, shaggy bison, with curved
                black horns shiny as onyx, grazed in clearings. Once a bear, grumbling and muttering irritably, lumbered
                across the trail in front of them. Rabbits scurried through the undergrowth and partridges exploded into
                flight from underfoot with a heartstopping thunder of wings. The ponds and streams abounded with fish,
                muskrat, otter, and beaver. There were also, they soon discovered, smaller forms of life. The mosquitoes
                seemed only slightly smaller than sparrows, and there was a nasty little brown fly that bit anything
                that moved.
            </p>
            <p>The sun rose early and set late, dappling the dark forest floor with golden light. Although it was
                midsummer now, it was never exactly hot, and the air was rich with that smell of urgent growth common to
                the lands of the north, where summer was short and winter very long.
            </p>
            <p>Belgarath seemed not to sleep at all once they entered the forest. Each evening, as Silk and Garion
                wearily rolled themselves in their blankets, the old sorcerer threaded his way back into the shadowy
                trees and disappeared. Once, several hours past dusk on a night filled with starlight, Garion awoke
                briefly and heard the loping touch of paws skittering lightly across a leaf carpeted clearing; even as
                he drifted back to sleep, he understood. The great silver wolf who was his grandfather roamed the night,
                scouring the surrounding forest for any hint of pursuit or danger.
            </p>
            <p>The old man's nocturnal roamings were as silent as smoke, but they did not pass unnoticed. Early one
                morning, before the sun rose and while the trees were still hazy and half obscured by ground fog,
                several shadowy shapes drifted among the dark trunks and stopped not far away. Garion, who had just
                risen and was preparing to stir up the fire, froze half bent over. As he slowly straightened, he could
                feel eyes on him, and his skin prickled peculiarly. Perhaps ten feet away stood a huge, dark gray wolf.
                The wolf's expression was serious, and its eyes were as yellow as sunlight. There was an unspoken
                question in those golden eyes, and Garion realized that he understood that question.
            </p>
            <p>"One wonders why you are doing that?"</p>
            <p>"Doing what?" Garion asked politely, responding automatically in the language of wolves.</p>
            <p>"Going about in that peculiar form."</p>
            <p>"It's necessary to do it."</p>
            <p>"Ah." With exquisite courtesy the wolf did not pursue the matter further. "One is curious to know if you
                don't find it somewhat restricting," he noted however.
            </p>
            <p>"It's not as bad as it looks - once one gets used to it."</p>
            <p>The wolf looked unconvinced. He sat down on his haunches. "One has seen the other one several times in
                the past few darknesses," he said in the manner of wolves, "and one is curious to know why you and he
                have come into our range."
            </p>
            <p>Garion knew instinctively that his answer to that question was going to be very important. "We are going
                from one place to another," he replied carefully. "It is not our intention to seek dens or mates in your
                range or to hunt the creatures that are yours." He could not have explained how he knew what to say.
            </p>
            <p>The wolf seemed satisfied with his response. "One would be pleased if you would present our esteem to the
                one with fur like frost," he said formally. "One has noted that he is worthy of great respect."
            </p>
            <p>"One would be pleased to give him your words," Garion responded, a bit surprised at how easily the
                elaborate phrasing came to him.
            </p>
            <p>The wolf lifted his head and sniffed at the air. "It is time for us to hunt," he said. "May you find what
                you seek."
            </p>
            <p>"May your hunt be successful," Garion returned.</p>
            <p>The wolf turned and padded back into the fog, followed by his companions.</p>
            <p>"On the whole, you handled that rather well, Garion," Belgarath said from the deep shadows of a nearby
                thicket.
            </p>
            <p>Garion jumped, a bit startled. "I didn't know you were there," he said.</p>
            <p>"You should have," the old man replied, stepping out of the shadows.</p>
            <p>"How did he know?" Garion asked. "That I'm a wolf sometimes, I mean?"</p>
            <p>"It shows. A wolf is very alert to that sort of thing."</p>
            <p>Silk came out from under the tree where he had been sleeping. The little man's step was wary, but his
                nose twitched with curiosity. "What was that all about?" he asked.
            </p>
            <p>"The wolves wanted to know what we were doing in their territory," Belgarath replied. "They were
                investigating to see if they were going to have to fight us."
            </p>
            <p>"Fight?" Garion was startled.</p>
            <p>"It's customary when a strange wolf enters the hunting range of another pack. Wolves prefer not to fight
                -
            </p>
            <p>it's a waste of energy - but they will, if the situation demands it."</p>
            <p>"What happened?" Silk asked. "Why did they just go away like that?"</p>
            <p>"Garion convinced them that we were just passing through."</p>
            <p>"That was clever of him."</p>
            <p>"Why don't you stir up the fire, Garion?" Belgarath suggested. "Let's have some breakfast and move on.
                It's still a long way to Mallorea, and we don't want to run out of good weather."
            </p>
            <p>Later that same day, they rode down into a valley where a collection of log houses and tents stood beside
                a fair-sized stream at the edge of a meadow.
            </p>
            <p>"Fur traders," Silk explained to Garion, pointing at the rough settlement. "'There are places like this
                on just about every major stream in this part of the forest." The little man's pointed nose began to
                twitch, and his eyes grew bright. "A lot of buying and selling goes on in these little towns."
            </p>
            <p>"Never mind," Belgarath told him pointedly. "Try to keep your predatory instincts under control."</p>
            <p>"I wasn't even considering anything," Silk protested.</p>
            <p>"Really? Aren't you feeling well?"</p>
            <p>Silk loftily ignored that.</p>
            <p>"Wouldn't it be safer to go around it?" Garion asked as they rode across the broad meadow.</p>
            <p>Belgarath shook his head. "I want to know what's going on ahead of us, and the quickest way to find out
                is to talk to people who've been there. We'll drift in, circulate for an hour or so and then drift on
                out again.
            </p>
            <p>Just keep your ears open. If anyone asks, we're on our way toward the north range to look for gold."</p>
            <p>There were differences between the hunters and trappers who roamed the streets of this settlement and the
                miners they had met in the last village. They were more open for one thing - less surly and distinctly
                less belligerent. Garion surmised that the enforced solitude of their occupation made them appreciate
                companionship all the more during their infrequent visits to the fur-trading centers. Although they
                drank probably as much as the miners, their drinking seemed to lead more often to singing and laughter
                than to fighting.
            </p>
            <p>A large tavern stood near the center of the village, and they rode slowly along a dirt street toward it.
                "Side door," Belgarath said tersely as they dismounted in front of the tavern, and they led their horses
                around the building and tied them at the porch railing.
            </p>
            <p>The interior of the tavern was cleaner, less crowded, and somewhat lighter than the miners' tavern had
                been, and it smelled of woods and open air instead of damp, musty earth. The three of them sat at a
                table not far from the door and ordered cups of ale from a polite servingman. The ale was a rich, dark
                brown, well chilled, and surprisingly inexpensive.
            </p>
            <p>"The fur buyers own the place," Silk explained, wiping foam from his upper lip. "They've discovered that
                a trapper is easier to bargain with if he's a little drunk, so they make the ale cheap and plentiful."
            </p>
            <p>"I suppose that makes sense," Garion admitted, "but don't the trappers know that?"</p>
            <p>"Of course they do."</p>
            <p>"Why do they drink before they do business, then?"</p>
            <p>Silk shrugged. "They like to drink."</p>
            <p>The two trappers seated at the next table were renewing an acquaintanceship that obviously stretched back
                a dozen years or more. Their beards were both touched with gray, but they spoke lightheartedly in the
                manner of much younger men.
            </p>
            <p>"You have any trouble with Morindim while you were up there?" one was asking the other.</p>
            <p>The second shook his head. "I put pestilence-markers on both ends of the valley where I set out my
                traps,"
            </p>
            <p>he replied. "A Morind will go a dozen leagues out of his way to avoid a spot that's got pestilence."</p>
            <p>The first nodded his agreement. "That's usually the best way. Gredder always claimed that curse-markers
                worked better; but as it turned out, he was wrong."
            </p>
            <p>"I haven't seen him in the last few seasons."</p>
            <p>"I'd be surprised if you had. The Morindim got him about three years ago. I buried him myself - what was
                left of him anyway."
            </p>
            <p>"Didn't know that. Spent a winter with him once over on the head waters of the Cordu. He was a
                mean-tempered sort of a man. I'm surprised that the Morindim would cross a curse-marker, though."
            </p>
            <p>"As near as I could judge, some magician came along and uncursed his markers. I found a dried weasel foot
                hung from one of them with three stems of grass tied around each toe."
            </p>
            <p>"That's a potent spell. They must have wanted him pretty badly for a magician to take that much
                trouble."
            </p>
            <p>"You know how he was. He could irritate people ten leagues away just walking by."</p>
            <p>"That's the truth."</p>
            <p>"Not any more, though. His skull's decorating some Morind magician's quest-staff now."</p>
            <p>Garion leaned toward his grandfather. "What do they mean when they talk about markers?" he whispered.</p>
            <p>"They're warnings," Belgarath replied. "Usually sticks poked into the ground and decorated with bones or
                feathers. The Morindim can't read, so you can't just put up a signboard for them."
            </p>
            <p>A stooped old trapper, his leather clothing patched and shiny from wear, shuffled toward the center of
                the tavern. His lined, bearded face had a slightly apologetic expression on it. Following after him came
                a young Nadrak woman in a heavy, red felt dress belted about the waist with a glittering chain. There
                was a leash about her neck, and the old trapper held the end of the tether firmly in his fist. Despite
                the leash, the young woman's face had a proud, disdainful look, and she stared at the men in the tavern
                with barely concealed contempt. When the old trapper reached the center of the room, he cleared his
                throat to get the attention of the crowd. "I've got a woman I want to sell," he announced loudly.
            </p>
            <p>Without changing expression the woman spat upon him.</p>
            <p>"Now you know that's just going to lower your price, Vella," the old man told her in a placating tone of
                voice.
            </p>
            <p>"You're an idiot, Tashor," she retorted. "No one here can afford me - you know that. Why didn't you do
                what I told you to and offer me to the fur buyers?"
            </p>
            <p>"The fur buyers aren't interested in women, Vella," Tashor replied in that same mild tone. "The price
                will be better here, believe me."
            </p>
            <p>"I wouldn't believe you if you said the sun was going to rise tomorrow, you old fool."</p>
            <p>"The woman, as you can see, is quite spirited," Tashor announced rather lamely.</p>
            <p>"Is he trying to sell his wife?" Garion demanded, choking on his ale.</p>
            <p>"She isn't his wife," Silk corrected. "He owns her, that's all."</p>
            <p>Garion clenched his fists and half rose, his face mottled with anger, but Belgarath's hand closed firmly
                about his wrist. "Sit down," the old man ordered.
            </p>
            <p>"But "</p>
            <p>"I said sit down, Garion. This is none of your business."</p>
            <p>"Unless you want to buy the woman, of course," Silk suggested lightly.</p>
            <p>"Is she healthy?" a leanfaced trapper with a scar across one cheek called to Tashor.</p>
            <p>"She is," Tashor declared, "and she's got all her teeth, too. Show them your teeth, Vella."</p>
            <p>"They aren't looking at my teeth, idiot," she told him, looking directly at the scar-faced trapper with a
                sultry challenge in her black eyes.
            </p>
            <p>"She's an excellent cook," Tashor continued quickly, "and she knows remedies for rheumatism and ague.</p>
            <p>She can dress and tan hides and she doesn't eat too much. Her breath doesn't smell too bad - unless she
                eats onions - and she almost never snores, except when she's drunk."
            </p>
            <p>"If she's such a good woman, why do you want to sell her?" the leanfaced trapper wanted to know.</p>
            <p>"I'm getting older," Tashor replied, "and I'd like a little peace and quiet. Vella's exciting to be
                around, but I've had all the excitement I need. I think I'd like to settle down someplace - maybe raise
                some chickens or goats." The bent old trapper's voice sounded a trifle plaintive.
            </p>
            <p>"Oh, this is impossible," Vella burst out. "Do I have to do everything myself? Get out of the way,
                Tashor."
            </p>
            <p>Rudely, she pushed the old trapper aside and glared at the crowd, her black eyes flashing. "All right,"
                she announced firmly, "let's get down to business. Tashor wants to sell me. I'm strong and healthy. I
                can cook, cure hides and skins, tend to common illnesses, bargain closely when I buy supplies, and I can
                brew good beer." Her eyes narrowed grimly. "I have not gone to any man's bed, and I keep my daggers
                sharp enough to persuade strangers not to try to force me. I can play the wood-flute and I know many old
                stories. I can make curse-markers and pestilence-markers and dream-markers to frighten off the Morindim
                and once I killed a bear at thirty paces with a bow."
            </p>
            <p>"Twenty paces," Tashor corrected mildly.</p>
            <p>"It was closer to thirty," she insisted.</p>
            <p>"Can you dance?" the lean trapper with the scarred face asked.</p>
            <p>She looked directly at him. "Only if you're seriously interested in buying me," she replied.</p>
            <p>"We can talk about that after I see you dance," he said.</p>
            <p>"Can you hold a beat?" she demanded.</p>
            <p>"I can."</p>
            <p>"Very well." Her hands went to the chain about her waist, and it jingled as she unfastened it. She opened
                the heavy red dress, stepped out of it, and handed it to Tashor. Then she carefully untied the leash
                from about her neck and bound a ribbon of red silk about her head to hold back her wealth of lustrous,
                blue-black hair. Beneath the red felt dress, she wore a filmy rosecolored gown of Mallorean silk that
                whispered and clung to her as she moved. The silk gown reached to midcalf, and she wore soft leather
                boots on her feet.
            </p>
            <p>Protruding from the top of each boot was the jeweled hilt of a dagger, and a third dagger rode on the
                leather belt about her waist. Her gown was caught in a tight collar about her throat, but it left her
                arms bare to the shoulder. She wore a half dozen narrow gold bracelets about each wrist. With a
                conscious grace, she bent and fastened a string of small bells to each ankle. Then she lifted her
                smoothly rounded arms until her hands were beside her face. "This is the beat, scar-face," she told the
                trapper. "Try to hold it." And she began to clap her hands together. The beat was three measured claps
                followed by four staccato ones. Vella began her dance slowly with a kind of insolent strut. Her gown
                whispered as she moved, its hem sighing about her lush calves.
            </p>
            <p>The lean trapper took up her beat, his callused hands clapping together loudly in the sudden silence as
                Vella danced.
            </p>
            <p>Garion began to blush. Vella's movements were subtle and fluid. The bells at her ankles and the bracelets
                about her wrists played a tinkling counterpoint to the trapper's beat. Her feet seemed almost to flicker
                in the intricate steps of her dance, and her arms wove patterns in the air. Other, even more
                interesting, things were going on inside the rosecolored, gossamer gown. Garion swallowed hard and
                discovered that he had almost stopped breathing.
            </p>
            <p>Vella began to whirl, and her long black hair flared out, almost perfectly matching the flare of her
                gown.
            </p>
            <p>Then she slowed and once again dropped back into that proud, sensual strut that challenged every man in
                the room.
            </p>
            <p>They cheered when she stopped, and she smiled a slow, mysterious little smile.</p>
            <p>"You dance very well," the scar-faced trapper observed in a neutral voice.</p>
            <p>"Naturally," she replied. "I do everything very well."</p>
            <p>"Are you in love with anyone?" The question was bluntly put.</p>
            <p>"No man has won my heart," Vella declared flatly. "I haven't seen a man yet who was worthy of me."</p>
            <p>"That may change," the trapper suggested. "One goldmark." It was a firm offer.</p>
            <p>"You're not serious," she snorted. "Five goldmarks."</p>
            <p>"One and a half," he countered.</p>
            <p>"This is just too insulting." Vella raised both hands up in the air, and her face took on a tragic
                expression.
            </p>
            <p>"Not a copper less than four."</p>
            <p>"Two goldmarks," the trapper offered.</p>
            <p>"Unbelievable!" she exclaimed, spreading both arms. "Why don't you just cut my heart out and have done
                with it? I couldn't consider anything less than three and a half."
            </p>
            <p>"To save time, why don't we just say three?" He said it firmly. "With intention that the arrangement
                become permanent," he added, almost as an afterthought.
            </p>
            <p>"Permanent?" Vella's eyes widened.</p>
            <p>"I like you," he replied. "Well, what do you say?"</p>
            <p>"Stand up and let me have a look at you," she ordered him. Slowly he unwound himself from the chair in
                which he had lounged. His tall body was as lean as his scarred face, and there was a hardmuscled quality
                about him. Vella pursed her lips and looked him over. "Not bad, is he?" she murmured to Tashor.
            </p>
            <p>"You could do worse, Vella," her owner answered encouragingly. "I'll consider your offer of three with
                intentions," Vella declared. "Have you got a name?"
            </p>
            <p>"Tekk," the tall trapper introduced himself with a slight bow.</p>
            <p>"Well then, Tekk," Vella told him, "don't go away. Tashor and I need to talk over your offer." She gave
                him an almost shy look. "I think I like you, too," she added in a much less challenging tone. Then she
                took hold of the leash that was still wrapped around Tashor's fist and led him out of the tavern,
                glancing back over her shoulder once or twice at the leanfaced Tekk.
            </p>
            <p>"That is a lot of woman," Silk murmured with a note of profound respect.</p>
            <p>Garion found that he was able to breathe again, though his ears still felt very hot. "What did they mean
                by intention?" he quietly asked Silk.
            </p>
            <p>"Tekk offered an arrangement that usually leads to marriage," Silk explained.</p>
            <p>That baffled Garion. "I don't understand at all," he confessed.</p>
            <p>"Just because someone owns her doesn't give him any special rights to her person," Silk told him, "and
                those daggers of hers enforce that. One does not approach a Nadrak woman unless one's tired of living.
                She makes that decision. The wedding customarily takes place after the birth of her first child."
            </p>
            <p>"Why was she so interested in the price?"</p>
            <p>"Because she gets half," Silk shrugged.</p>
            <p>"She gets half of the money every time she's sold?" Garion was incredulous.</p>
            <p>"Of course. It'd hardly be fair otherwise, would it?"</p>
            <p>The servingman who was bringing them three more cups of ale had stopped and was staring openly at Silk.
            </p>
            <p>"Is something wrong, friend?" Silk asked him mildly.</p>
            <p>The servingman lowered his eyes quickly. "Sorry," he mumbled. "I just thought - you reminded me of
                somebody, that's all. Now that I see you closer, I realize that I was mistaken." He put down the cups
                quickly, turned, and left without picking up the coins Silk had laid on the table.
            </p>
            <p>"I think we'd better leave," Silk said quietly.</p>
            <p>"What's the matter?" Garion asked him.</p>
            <p>"He knows who I am - and there's that reward notice that's being circulated."</p>
            <p>"Maybe you're right," Belgarath agreed, rising to his feet.</p>
            <p>"He's talking with those men over there," Garion said, watching the servingman, who was in urgent
                conversation with a group of hunters on the far side of the room and was casting frequent looks in their
                direction.
            </p>
            <p>"We've got about a half a minute to get outside," Silk said tensely. "Let's go."</p>
            <p>The three of them moved quickly toward the door.</p>
            <p>"You there!" someone behind them shouted. "Wait a minute!"</p>
            <p>"Run!" Belgarath barked, and they bolted outside and hurled themselves into their saddles just as a half
                dozen leather-garbed men burst out through the tavern door.
            </p>
            <p>The shout, "Stop those men!" went largely unheeded as they galloped off down the street. Trappers and
                hunters as a breed were seldom inclined to mix themselves in other men's affairs, and Garion, Silk, and
                Belgarath had passed through the village and were splashing across a ford before any kind of pursuit
                could be organized.
            </p>
            <p>Silk was swearing as they entered the forest on the far side of the river, spitting out oaths like melon
                seeds.
            </p>
            <p>His profanity was colorful arid wide-ranging, reflecting on the birth, parentage, and uncleanly habits of
                not only those pursuing them, but of those responsible for circulating the reward notice as well.
            </p>
            <p>Belgarath reined in sharply, raising his hand as he did. Silk and Garion hauled their horses to a stop.
                Silk continued to swear.
            </p>
            <p>"Do you suppose you could cut short your eloquence for a moment?" Belgarath asked him. "I'm trying to
                listen."
            </p>
            <p>Silk muttered a few more choice oaths, then clamped his teeth shut. There were confused shouts far behind
                them and a certain amount of splashing.
            </p>
            <p>"They're crossing the stream," Belgarath noted. "It looks as if they plan to take the business
                seriously.
            </p>
            <p>Seriously enough to chase us, at any rate."</p>
            <p>"Won't they give up when it gets dark?" Garion asked.</p>
            <p>"These are Nadrak hunters," Silk said, sounding profoundly disgusted. "They'll follow us for days just
                for the enjoyment of the hunt."
            </p>
            <p>"There's not much we can do about that now," Belgarath grunted. "Let's see if we can outrun them." And he
                thumped his heels to his horse.
            </p>
            <p>It was midafternoon as they rode at a gallop through the sunlit forest. The undergrowth was scanty, and
                the tall, straight trunks of fir and pine rose like great columns toward the blue sky overhead. It was a
                good day for a ride, but not a good day for being chased. No day was good for that.
            </p>
            <p>They topped a rise and stopped again to listen.</p>
            <p>"They seem to be falling behind," Garion noted hopefully.</p>
            <p>"That's just the drunk ones," Silk disagreed sourly. "The ones who are serious about all this are
                probably much closer. You don't shout when you're hunting. See - look back there." He pointed.
            </p>
            <p>Garion looked. There was a pale flicker back among the trees. A man on a white horse was riding in their
                direction, leaning far over in his saddle and looking intently at the ground as he rode.
            </p>
            <p>"If he's any kind of tracker at all, it will take us a week to shake him off," Silk said disgustedly.</p>
            <p>Somewhere, far off among the trees to their right, a wolf howled. "Let's keep going," Belgarath told
                them.
            </p>
            <p>They galloped on then, plunging down the far side of the rise, threading their way among the trees, The
                thud of their horses' hoofs was a muffled drumming on the thick loam of the forest floor, and clots of
                half decayed debris spattered out behind them as they fled.
            </p>
            <p>"We're leaving a trail as wide as a house," Silk shouted to Belgarath.</p>
            <p>"That can't be helped for now," the old man replied. "We need some more distance before we start playing
                games with the tracks."
            </p>
            <p>Another howl drifted mournfully through the forest, from the left this time. It seemed a bit closer than
                the first had been.
            </p>
            <p>They rode on for another quarter of an hour and then they suddenly heard a great babble of confusion to
                the rear. Men were shouting with alarm, and horses squealed in panic. Garion could also hear savage
                growls.
            </p>
            <p>At Belgarath's signal, they slowed their horses to listen. The terrified squeals of horses rang sharply
                through the trees, punctuated by their riders' curses and frightened shouts. A chorus of howls rose from
                all around.
            </p>
            <p>The forest seemed suddenly full of wolves. The pursuit behind them disintegrated as the horses of the
                Nadrak reward hunters bolted with screams of sheer panic in all directions.
            </p>
            <p>With a certain grim satisfaction, Belgarath listened to the fading sounds behind them. Then, his tongue
                lolling from his mouth, a huge, dark-furred wolf trotted out of the woods about thirty yards away,
                stopped, and dropped to his haunches, his yellow eyes gazing intently at them.
            </p>
            <p>"Keep a tight grip on your reins," Belgarath instructed quietly, stroking the neck of his suddenly
                wild-eyed mount.
            </p>
            <p>The wolf did not say anything, but merely sat and watched. Belgarath returned that steady gaze quite
                calmly, then finally nodded once in acknowledgment. The wolf rose, turned, and started off into the
                trees.
            </p>
            <p>He stopped once, glanced back over his shoulder at them, and raised his muzzle to lift the deep,
                bell-toned howl that summoned the other members of his pack to return to their interrupted hunt. Then,
                with a flicker he was gone, and only the echo of his howl remained.
            </p>
        </chapter>
        <chapter number="4">
            <p>THEY RODE EAST for the next several days, gradually descending into a broad, marshy valley where the
                undergrowth was denser and the air noticeably more humid. A brief summer shower rolled in one afternoon,
                accompanied by great, ripping crashes of thunder, a deluge of pounding rain, and winds that howled among
                the trees, bending and tossing them and tearing leaves and twigs from the underbrush to

            </p>
            <p>whirl and fly among the dark trunks. The storm soon passed, however, and the sun came out again. After
                that, the weather continued fair, and they made good time.
            </p>
            <p>Garion felt a peculiar sense of incompleteness as he rode and he sometimes caught himself looking around
                for missing friends. The long journey in search of the Orb had established a sort of pattern in his
                mind, a sense of rightness and wrongness, and this trip felt wrong. Barak was not with them, for one
                thing, and the big, red-bearded Cherek's absence made Garion feel oddly insecure. He also missed the
                hawkfaced, silent Hettar and the armored form of Mandorallen riding always at the front, with the
                silver-and-blue pennon snapping from the tip of his lance. He was painfully lonely for Durnik the smith
                and he even missed Ce'Nedra's spiteful bickering. What had happened at Riva became less and less real to
                him, and all the elaborate ceremony that had attended his betrothal to the impossible little princess
                began to fade in his memory, like some half forgotten dream.
            </p>
            <p>It was one evening, however, after the horses had been picketed and supper was over and they had rolled
                themselves in their blankets to sleep, that Garion, staring into the dying embers of their fire, came at
                last to face the central vacancy that had entered his life. Aunt Pol was not with them, and he missed
                her terribly.
            </p>
            <p>Since childhood, he had felt that, so long as Aunt Pol was nearby, nothing could really go wrong that she
                could not fix. Her calm, steady presence had been the one thing to which he had always clung. As clearly
                as if she stood before him, Garion could see her face, her glorious eyes, and the white lock at her
                brow; the sudden loneliness for her was as sharp as the edge of a knife.
            </p>
            <p>Everything felt wrong without her. Belgarath was here, certainly, and Garion was fairly sure that his
                grandfather could deal with any purely physical dangers, but there were other, less obvious perils that
                the old man either did not consider or chose to ignore. To whom could Garion turn when he was afraid,
                for example? Being afraid was not the sort of thing that endangered life or limb, but it was still an
                injury of sorts and sometimes a deeper and more serious kind of injury. Aunt Pol had always been able to
                banish his fears, but now she was not here, and Garion was afraid and he could not even admit it. He
                sighed and pulled his blankets more closely about him and slowly drifted into a troubled sleep.
            </p>
            <p>It was about noon some days later when they reached the east fork of the River Cordu, a broad, dirty
                brown flow running through a brushy valley in a generally southerly direction toward the capital at Yar
                Nadrak.
            </p>
            <p>The pale green, waist-high brush extended back several hundred yards from either bank of the river and
                was silt-smeared by the high waters of the spring runoff. The sultry air above the brush was alive with
                clouds of gnats and mosquitoes.
            </p>
            <p>A sullen boatman ferried them across to the village standing on the far bank. As they led their horses
                off onto the ferry landing, Belgarath spoke quietly. "I think we'll want to change direction here," he
                told them.
            </p>
            <p>"Let's split up. I'll go pick up supplies, and the two of you go find the town tavern. See if you can get
                some information about passes leading up through the north range into the lands of the Morindim. The
                sooner we get up there, the better. The Malloreans seem to be getting the upper hand here and they could
                clamp down without much warning. I don't want to have to start explaining my every move to Mallorean
                Grolims - not to mention the fact that there's a great deal of interest in Silk's whereabouts just now."
            </p>
            <p>Silk rather glumly agreed. "I'd like to get that matter straightened out, but I don't suppose we really
                have the time, do we?"
            </p>
            <p>"No, not really. The summer is very, very short up north, and the crossing to Mallorea is unpleasant,
                even in the best weather. When you get to the tavern, tell everybody that we want to try our luck in the
                gold fields of the north range. There's bound to be somebody around who'll want to show off his
                familiarity with trails and passes-particularly if you offer to buy him a few drinks."
            </p>
            <p>"I thought you said you knew the way," Silk protested.</p>
            <p>"I know one way - but it's a hundred leagues east of here. Let's see if there's something a little
                closer. I'll come by the tavern after I get the supplies." The old man mounted and went off up the dirt
                street, leading their packhorse behind him.
            </p>
            <p>Silk and Garion had little trouble finding someone in the smelly tavern willing to talk about trails and
                passes. Quite to the contrary, their first question sparked a general debate.
            </p>
            <p>"That's the long way around, Besher," one tipsy gold hunter interrupted another's detailed description of
                a mountain pass. "You go left at the falls of the stream. It saves you three days."
            </p>
            <p>"I'm telling this, Varn," Besher retorted testily, banging his fist down on the scarred table. "You can
                tell them about the way you go when I'm finished."
            </p>
            <p>"It'll take you all day just like that trail you're so fond of. They want to go look for gold, not admire
                scenery." Varn's long, stubbled jaw thrust out belligerently.
            </p>
            <p>"Which way do we go when we get to the long meadow up on top?" Silk asked quickly, trying to head off the
                hostilities.
            </p>
            <p>"You go right," Besher declared, glaring at Varn.</p>
            <p>Varn thought about that as if looking for an excuse to disagree. Finally he reluctantly nodded. "Of
                course that's the only way you can go," he added, "but once you get through the juniper grove, you turn
                left." He said it in the tone of a man anticipating contradiction.
            </p>
            <p>"Left?" Besher objected loudly. "You're a blockhead, Varn. You go right again."</p>
            <p>"Watch who you're calling a blockhead, you jackass!"</p>
            <p>Without any further discussion, Besher punched Varn in the mouth, and the two of them began to pummel
                each other, reeling about and knocking over benches and tables.
            </p>
            <p>"They're both wrong, of course," another miner sitting at a nearby table observed calmly, watching the
                fight with a clinical detachment. "You keep going straight after you get through the juniper grove."
            </p>
            <p>Several burly men, wearing loose-fitting red tunics over their polished mail shirts, had entered the
                tavern unnoticed during the altercation, and they stepped forward, grinning, to separate Varn and Besher
                as the two rolled around on the dirty floor. Garion felt Silk stiffen beside him.
            </p>
            <p>"Malloreans!" the little man said softly.</p>
            <p>"What do we do?" Garion whispered, looking around for a way of escape. But before Silk could answer, a
                black-robed Grolim stepped through the door.
            </p>
            <p>"I like to see men who are so eager to fight," the Grolim purred in a peculiar accent. "The army needs
                such men."
            </p>
            <p>"Recruiters!" Varn exclaimed, breaking away from the red-garbed Malloreans and dashing toward a side
                door. For a second it looked as if he might escape; but as he reached the doorway, someone outside
                rapped him sharply across the forehead with a stout cudgel. He reeled back, suddenly rubber-legged and
                vacant-eyed. The Mallorean who had hit him came inside, gave him a critical, appraising glance, and then
                judiciously clubbed him in the head again.
            </p>
            <p>"Well?" the Grolim asked, looking around with amusement. "What's it to be? Would any more of you like to
                run, or would you all prefer to come along quietly?"
            </p>
            <p>"Where are you taking us?" Besher demanded, trying to pull his arm out of the grip of one of the grinning
                recruiters.
            </p>
            <p>"To Yar Nadrak first," the Grolim replied, "and then south to the plains of Mishrak ac Thull and the
                encampment of his Imperial Majesty 'Zakath, Emperor of all Mallorea. You've just joined the army, my
                friends. All of Angarak rejoices in your courage and patriotism, and Torak himself is pleased with you."
                As if to emphasize his words, the Grolim's hand strayed to the hilt of the sacrificial knife sheathed at
                his belt.
            </p>
            <p>The chain clinked spitefully as Garion, fettered at the ankle, plodded along, one in a long line of
                disconsolate-looking conscripts, following a trail leading generally southward through the brush along
                the riverbank. The conscripts had all been roughly searched for weapons-all but Garion, who for some
                reason had been overlooked. He was painfully aware of the huge sword strapped to his back as he walked
                along; but, as always seemed to happen, no one else paid any attention to it.
            </p>
            <p>Before they had left the village, while they were all being shackled, Garion and Silk had held a brief,
                urgent discussion in the minute finger movements of the Drasnian secret language.
            </p>
            <p>I could pick this lock with my thumbnail-Silk had asserted with a disdainful flip of his fingers. As soon
                as it gets dark tonight, I'll unhook us and we'll leave. I don't really think military life would agree
                with me, and it's wildly inappropriate for you to be joining an Angarak army just now - all things
                considered.
            </p>
            <p>-Where's Grandfather? Garion had asked.</p>
            <p>-Oh, I imagine he's about.</p>
            <p>Garion, however, was worried, and a whole platoon of "what-ifs" immediately jumped into his mind. To
                avoid thinking about them, he covertly studied the Malloreans who guarded them. The Grolim and the bulk
                of his detachment had moved on, once the captives had been shackled, seeking other villages and other
                recruits, leaving only five of their number behind to escort this group south. Malloreans were somewhat
                different from other Angaraks. Their eyes had that characteristic angularity, but their bodies seemed
                not to have the singleness of purpose which so dominated the western tribes. They were burly, but they
                did not have the broad-shouldered athleticism of the Murgos. They were tall, but did not have the lean,
                whippetlike frames of the Nadraks. They were obviously strong, but they did not have the thick-waisted
                brute power of Thulls. There was about them, moreover, a kind of disdainful superiority when they looked
                at western Angaraks. They spoke to their prisoners in short, barking commands, and when they talked to
                each other, their dialect was so thick that it was nearly unintelligible. They wore mail shirts covered
                by coarse-woven red tunics. They did not ride their horses very well, Garion noted, and their curved
                swords and broad, round shields seemed to get in their way as they attempted to manage their reins.
            </p>
            <p>Garion carefully kept his head down to hide the fact that his features - even more than Silk's - were
                distinctly non-Angarak. The guards, however, paid little attention to the conscripts as individuals, but
                seemed rather to be more interested in them as numbers. They rode continually up and down the sweating
                column, counting bodies and referring to a document they carried with concerned, even worried
                expressions. Garion surmised that unpleasant things would happen if the numbers did not match when they
                reached Yar Nadrak.
            </p>
            <p>A faint, pale flicker in the underbrush some distance uphill from the trail caught Garion's eye, and he
                turned his head sharply in that direction. A large, silver-gray wolf was ghosting along just at the edge
                of the trees, his pace exactly matching theirs. Garion quickly lowered his head again, pretended to
                stumble, and fell heavily against Silk. "Grandfather's out there," he whispered.
            </p>
            <p>"Did you only just notice him?" Silk sounded surprised. "I've been watching him for the last hour or
                more."
            </p>
            <p>When the trail turned away from the river and entered the trees, Garion felt the tension building up in
                him.
            </p>
            <p>He could not be sure what Belgarath was going to do, but he knew that the concealment offered by the
                forest provided the opportunity for which his grandfather had doubtless been waiting. He tried to hide
                his growing nervousness as he walked along behind Silk, but the slightest sound in the woods around them
                made him start uncontrollably.
            </p>
            <p>The trail dipped down into a fair-sized clearing, surrounded on all sides by tall ferns, and the
                Mallorean guards halted the column to allow their prisoners to rest. Garion sank gratefully to the
                springy turf beside Silk. The effort of walking with one leg shackled to the long chain which bound the
                conscripts together was considerable, and he found that he was sweating profusely. "What's he waiting
                for?" he whispered to Silk.
            </p>
            <p>The rat-faced little man shrugged. "It's still a few hours until dark," he replied softly. "Maybe he
                wants to wait for that."
            </p>
            <p>Then, some distance up the trail, they heard the sound of singing. The song was ribald and badly out of
                tune, but the singer was quite obviously enjoying himself, and the slurring of the words as he drew
                closer indicated that he was more than a little drunk.
            </p>
            <p>The Malloreans grinned at each other. "Another patriot, perhaps," one of them smirked, "coming to
                enlist.
            </p>
            <p>Spread out, and we'll gather him up as soon as he comes into the clearing."</p>
            <p>The singing Nadrak rode into view on a large roan horse. He wore the usual dark, stained leather
                clothing, and a fur cap perched precariously on one side of his head. He had a scraggly black beard, and
                he carried a wineskin in one hand. He seemed to be swaying in his saddle as he rode, but something about
                his eyes showed him not to be quite so drunk as he appeared. Garion stared at him openly as he rode into
                the clearing with a string of mules behind him. It was Yarblek, the Nadrak merchant they had encountered
                on the South Caravan Route in Cthol Murgos.
            </p>
            <p>"Ho, there!" Yarblek greeted the Malloreans in a loud voice. "I see you've had good hunting. That's a
                healthy-looking bunch of recruits you've got there."
            </p>
            <p>"The hunting just got easier." One of the Malloreans grinned at him, pulling his horse across the trail
                to block Yarblek's way.
            </p>
            <p>"You mean me?" Yarblek laughed uproariously. "Don't be a fool. I'm too busy to play soldier."</p>
            <p>"That's a shame," the Mallorean replied.</p>
            <p>"I'm Yarblek, a merchant of Yar Turak and a friend of King Drosta himself. I'm acting on a commission
                that he personally put into my hands. If you interfere with me in any way, Drosta will have you flayed
                and roasted alive as soon as you get to Yar Nadrak."
            </p>
            <p>The Mallorean looked a trifle less sure of himself "We answer only to 'Zakath," he asserted a bit
                defensively. "King Drosta has no authority over us."
            </p>
            <p>"You're in Gar og Nadrak, friend," Yarblek pointed out to him, "and Drosta does whatever he likes here.
                He might have to apologize to 'Zakath after it's all over, but by then the five of you will probably be
                peeled and cooked to a turn."
            </p>
            <p>"I suppose you can prove that you're on official business?" the Mallorean guard hedged.</p>
            <p>"Of course I can," Yarblek replied. He scratched at his head, his face taking on an expression of foolish
                perplexity. "Where did I put that parchment?" he muttered to himself. Then he snapped his fingers. "Oh,
                yes," he said, "now I remember. It's in the pack on that last mule. Here, have a drink, and I'll go get
                it." He tossed the wineskin to the Mallorean, turned his horse and rode back to the end of his pack
                string. He dismounted and began rummaging through a canvas pack.
            </p>
            <p>"We'd better have a look at his documents before we decide," one of the others advised. "King Drosta's
                not the sort you want to cross."
            </p>
            <p>"We might as well have a drink while we're waiting," another suggested, eyeing the wineskin.</p>
            <p>"That's one thing we can agree on," the first replied, working loose the stopper of the leather bag. He
                raised the skin with both hands and lifted his chin to drink.
            </p>
            <p>There was a solid-sounding thud, and the feathered shaft of an arrow was quite suddenly protruding from
                his throat, just at the top of his red tunic. The wine gushed from the skin to pour down over his
                astonished face. His companions gaped at him, then reached for their weapons with cries of alarm, but it
                was too late.
            </p>
            <p>Most of them tumbled from their saddles in the sudden storm of arrows that struck them from the
                concealment of the ferns. One, however, wheeled his mount to flee, clutching at the shaft buried deep in
                his side. The horse took no more than two leaps before three arrows sank into the Mallorean's back. He
                stiffened, then toppled over limply, his foot hanging up in his stirrup as he fell, and his frightened
                horse bolted, dragging him, bouncing and flopping, back down the trail.
            </p>
            <p>"I can't seem to locate that document," Yarblek declared, walking back with a wicked grin on his face. He
                turned the Mallorean he had been speaking to over with his foot. "You didn't really want to see it
                anyway, did you?" he asked the dead man.
            </p>
            <p>The Mallorean with the arrow in his throat stared blankly up at the sky, his mouth agape and a trickle of
                blood running out of his nose. "I didn't think so." Yarblek laughed coarsely. He drew back his foot and
                kicked the dead man back over onto his face. Then he turned to smirk at Silk as his archers came out of
                the dark green ferns. "You certainly get around, Silk," he said. "I thought Taur Urgas had finished you
                back there in stinking Cthol Murgos."
            </p>
            <p>"He miscalculated," Silk replied casually.</p>
            <p>"How did you manage to get yourself conscripted into the Mallorean army?" Yarblek asked curiously, all
                traces of his feigned drunkenness gone now.
            </p>
            <p>Silk shrugged. "I got careless."</p>
            <p>"I've been following you for the last three days."</p>
            <p>"I'm touched by your concern." Silk lifted his fettered ankle and jingled the chain. "Would it be too
                much trouble for you to unlock this?"
            </p>
            <p>"You're not going to do anything foolish, are you?"</p>
            <p>"Of course not."</p>
            <p>"Find the key," Yarblek told one of his archers.</p>
            <p>"What are you going to do with us?" Besher asked nervously, eyeing the dead guards with a certain
                apprehension.
            </p>
            <p>Yarblek laughed. "What you do once that chain's off is up to you," he answered indifferently. "I wouldn't
                recommend staying in the vicinity of so many dead Malloreans, though. Somebody might come along and
                start asking questions."
            </p>
            <p>"You're just going to let us go?" Besher demanded incredulously.</p>
            <p>"I'm certainly not going to feed you," Yarblek told him.</p>
            <p>The archers went down the chain, unlocking the shackles, and each Nadrak bolted into the bushes as soon
                as he was free.
            </p>
            <p>"Well, then," Yarblek said, rubbing his palms together, "now that that's been taken care of, why don't we
                have a drink?"
            </p>
            <p>"That guard spilled all your wine when he fell off his horse," Silk pointed out.</p>
            <p>"That wasn't my wine," Yarblek snorted. "I stole it this morning. You should know I wouldn't offer my own
                drink to somebody I planned to kill."
            </p>
            <p>"I wondered about that." Silk grinned at him. "I thought that maybe your manners had started to slip."
            </p>
            <p>Yarblek's coarse face took on a faintly injured expression.</p>
            <p>"Sorry," Silk apologized quickly. "I misjudged you."</p>
            <p>"No harm done." Yarblek shrugged. "A lot of people misunderstand me." He sighed. "It's a burden I have to
                bear." He opened a pack on his lead mule and hefted out a small keg of ale. He set it on the ground and
                broached it with a practiced skill, bashing in its top with his fist. "Let's get drunk," he suggested.
            </p>
            <p>"We'd really like to," Silk declined politely, "but we've got some rather urgent business to take care
                of."
            </p>
            <p>"You have no idea how sorry I am about that," Yarblek replied, fishing several cups out of the pack.</p>
            <p>"I knew you'd understand."</p>
            <p>"Oh, I understand, all right, Silk." Yarblek bent and dipped two cups into the ale keg. "And I'm as sorry
                as I can be that your business is going to have to wait. Here." He gave Silk one cup and Garion the
                other. Then he turned and dipped out a cup for himself.
            </p>
            <p>Silk looked at him with one raised eyebrow.</p>
            <p>Yarblek sprawled on the ground beside the ale keg, comfortably resting his feet on the body of one of the
                dead Malloreans. "You see, Silk," he explained, "the whole point of all this is that Drosta wants you
                very badly. He's offering a reward for you that's just too attractive to pass up. Friendship is one
                thing, but business is business, after all. Now, why don't you and your young friend make yourselves
                comfortable?
            </p>
            <p>This is a nice, shady clearing with soft moss to lie on. We'll all get drunk, and you can tell me how you
                managed to escape from Taur Urgas. Then you can tell me what happened to that handsome woman you had
                with you down in Cthol Murgos. Maybe I can make enough money from this to be able to afford to buy her.
                I'm not the marrying kind, but by Torak's teeth, that's a fine-looking woman. I'd almost be willing to
                give up my freedom for her."
            </p>
            <p>"I'm sure she'd be flattered," Silk replied. "What then?"</p>
            <p>"What when?"</p>
            <p>"After we get drunk. What do we do then?"</p>
            <p>"We'll probably get sick - that's what usually happens. After we get well, we'll run on down to Yar
                Nadrak.
            </p>
            <p>I'll collect the reward for you, and you'll be able to find out why King Drosta lek Thun wants to get his
                hands on you so badly." He looked at Silk with an amused expression. "You might as well sit down and
                have a drink, my friend. You aren't going anywhere just now."
            </p>
        </chapter>
        <chapter number="5">
            <p>YAR NADRAK WAS a walled city, lying at the juncture of the east and west forks of the River Cordu.</p>
            <p>The forests had been cleared for a league or so in every direction from the capital by the simple
                expedient of setting fire to it, and the approach to the city passed through a wilderness of burned
                black snags and rank-growing bramble thickets. The city gates were stout and smeared with tar.
                Surmounting them was a stone replica of the mask of Torak. That beautiful, inhumanly cruel face gazed
                down at all who entered, and Garion suppressed a shudder as he rode under it.
            </p>
            <p>The houses in the Nadrak capital were all very tall and had steeply sloping roofs. The windows of the
                second storeys all had shutters, and most of the shutters were closed. Any exposed wood on the
                structures had been smeared with tar to preserve it, and the splotches of the black substance made all
                the buildings look somehow diseased.
            </p>
            <p>There was a sullen, frightened air in the narrow, crooked streets of Yar Nadrak, and the inhabitants kept
                their eyes lowered as they hurried about their business. There appeared to be less leather involved in
                the clothing of the burghers of the capital than had been the case in the back country, but even here
                most garments were black, and only occasionally was there a splash of blue or yellow. The sole exception
                to this rule was the red tunic worn by the Mallorean soldiers. They seemed to be everywhere, roaming at
                will up and down the cobblestoned streets, accosting citizens rudely and talking loudly to each other in
                their heavily accented speech.
            </p>
            <p>While the soldiers seemed for the most part to be merely swaggering bullies, young men who concealed
                their nervousness at being in a strange country with an outward show of bluster and braggadocio, the
                Mallorean Grolims were quite another matter. Unlike the western Grolims Garion had seen in Cthol Murgos,
                they rarely wore the polished steel mask, but rather assumed a set, grim expression, thin-lipped and
                narrow-eyed; as they went about the streets in their hooded black robes, everyone, Mallorean and Nadrak
                alive, gave way to them.
            </p>
            <p>Garion and Silk, closely guarded and mounted on a pair of mules, followed the rangy Yarblek into the
                city.
            </p>
            <p>Yarblek and Silk had kept up their banter during the entire ride downriver, exchanging casual insults and
                reliving past indiscretions. Although he seemed friendly enough, Yarblek nonetheless remained watchful,
                and his men had guarded Silk and Garion every step of the way. Garion had covertly watched the forest
                almost continually during the three-day ride, but he had seen no sign of Belgarath and he entered the
                city in a state of jumpy apprehension. Silk, however, seemed relaxed and confident as always, and his
                behavior and attitude grated at Garion's nerves, for some reason.
            </p>
            <p>After they had clattered along a crooked street for some distance, Yarblek turned down a narrow, dirty
                alleyway leading toward the river. "I thought the palace was that way," Silk said to him, pointing
                toward the center of town.
            </p>
            <p>"It is," Yarblek replied, "but we aren't going to the palace. Drosta's got company there, and he prefers
                to do business in private." The alleyway soon opened out into a seedy-looking street where the tall,
                narrow-looking houses had fallen somewhat into disrepair. The lanky Nadrak clamped his mouth shut as two
                Mallorean Grolims rounded a corner just ahead and came in their direction. Yarblek's expression was
                openly hostile as the two approached.
            </p>
            <p>One of them stopped to return his gaze. "You seem to have a problem, friend," the Grolim suggested.</p>
            <p>"That's my business, isn't it?" Yarblek retorted.</p>
            <p>"Indeed it is," the Grolim replied coolly. "Don't let it get out of hand, though. Open disrespect for the
                priesthood is the sort of thing that could get you into serious trouble." The black-robed man's look was
                threatening.
            </p>
            <p>On a sudden impulse, Garion carefully pushed out his mind toward the Grolim, probing very gently, but the
                thoughts he encountered showed no particular awareness and certainly none of the aura that always seemed
                to emanate from the mind of a sorcerer.
            </p>
            <p>"Don't do that,"the voice in his mind cautioned him. "It's like ringing a bell or wearing a sign around
                your neck."
            </p>
            <p>Garion quickly pulled back his thoughts. "I thought all Grolims were sorcerers," he replied silently.
                "These two are just ordinary men." But the other awareness was gone.
            </p>
            <p>The two Grolims passed, and Yarblek spat contemptuously into the street. "Pigs," he muttered. "I'm
                starting to dislike Malloreans almost as much as Murgos."
            </p>
            <p>"They seem to be taking over your country, Yarblek," Silk observed.</p>
            <p>Yarblek grunted. "Let one Mallorean in, and before long they're underfoot everywhere."</p>
            <p>"Why did you let them in to begin with?" Silk asked mildly.</p>
            <p>"Silk," Yarblek said bluntly, "I know you're a spy, and I'm not going to discuss politics with you, so
                quit fishing for information."
            </p>
            <p>"Just passing the time of day," Silk replied innocently.</p>
            <p>"Why don't you mind your own business?"</p>
            <p>"But this is my business, old friend."</p>
            <p>Yarblek stared hard at him, then suddenly laughed.</p>
            <p>"Where are we going?" Silk asked him, looking around at the shabby street. "This isn't the best part of
                town, as I recall."
            </p>
            <p>"You'll find out," Yarblek told him.</p>
            <p>They rode on down toward the river where the smell of floating garbage and open sewers was quite nearly
                overpowering. Garion saw rats feeding in the gutters, and the men in the street wore shabby clothing and
                had the furtive look of those who have reason to avoid the police.
            </p>
            <p>Yarblek turned his horse abruptly and led them into another narrow, filthy alleyway. "We walk from
                here,"
            </p>
            <p>he said, dismounting. "I want to go in the back way." Leaving their mounts with one of his men, they went
                on down the alley, stepping carefully over piles of rotting garbage.
            </p>
            <p>"Down there," Yarblek told them, pointing at a short, rickety flight of wooden stairs leading down to a
                narrow doorway. "Once we get inside, keep your heads down. We don't want too many people noticing that
                you're not Nadraks."
            </p>
            <p>They went down the creaking steps and slipped through the doorway into a dim, smoky tavern, reeking of
                sweat, spilled beer, and stale vomit. The fire pit in the center of the room was choked with ashes, and
                several large logs smoldered there, giving off a great deal of smoke and very little light. Two narrow,
                dirty windows at the front appeared only slightly less dark than the walls around them, and a single oil
                lamp hung on a chain nailed to one of the rafters.
            </p>
            <p>"Sit here," Yarblek instructed them, nudging at a bench standing against the back wall. "I'll be right
                back."
            </p>
            <p>He went off toward the front part of the tavern. Garion looked around quickly, but saw immediately that a
                pair of Yarblek's men lounged unobtrusively beside the door.
            </p>
            <p>"What are we going to do?" he whispered to Silk.</p>
            <p>"We don't have much choice but to wait and see what happens," Silk replied.</p>
            <p>"You don't seem very worried."</p>
            <p>"I'm not, really."</p>
            <p>"But we've been arrested, haven't we?"</p>
            <p>Silk shook his head. "When you arrest somebody, you put shackles on him. King Drosta wants to talk to me,
                that's all."
            </p>
            <p>"But that reward notice said-"</p>
            <p>"I wouldn't pay too much attention to that, Garion. The reward notice was for the benefit of the
                Malloreans.
            </p>
            <p>Whatever Drosta's up to, he doesn't want them finding out about it."</p>
            <p>Yarblek threaded his way back through the crowd in the tavern and thumped himself down on the grimy bench
                beside them. "Drosta should be here, shortly," he said. "You want something to drink while we're
                waiting?"
            </p>
            <p>Silk looked around with a faint expression of distaste. "I don't think so," he replied. "The ale barrels
                in places like this usually have a few drowned rats floating in them - not to mention the dead flies and
                roaches."
            </p>
            <p>"Suit yourself," Yarblek said.</p>
            <p>"Isn't this a peculiar sort of place to find a king?" Garion asked, looking around at the shabby interior
                of the tavern.
            </p>
            <p>"You have to know King Drosta to understand," Silk told him. "He has some rather notorious appetites, and
                these riverfront dives suit him."
            </p>
            <p>Yarblek laughed in agreement. "Our monarch's a lusty sort of fellow," he noted, "but don't ever make the
                mistake of thinking he's stupid - a little crude, perhaps, but not stupid. He can come to a place like
                this, and no Mallorean will take the trouble to follow him. He's found that it's a good way to conduct
                business that he prefers not to have reported back to 'Zakath."
            </p>
            <p>There was a stir near the front of the tavern, and two heavy-shouldered Nadraks in black leather tunics
                and pointed helmets pushed their way through the door. "Make way!" one of them barked. "And everybody
                rise!"
            </p>
            <p>"Those who are able to rise," the other added dryly.</p>
            <p>A wave of jeers and catcalls ran through the crowd as a thin man in a yellow satin doublet and a
                fur-trimmed green velvet cloak entered. His eyes were bulging and his face was deeply scarred with old
                pockmarks. His movements were quick and jerky, and his expression was a curious mixture of sardonic
                amusement and a kind of desperate, unsatisfied hunger.
            </p>
            <p>"All hail his Majesty, Drosta lek Thun, King of the Nadraks!" one drunken man proclaimed in a loud voice,
                and the others in the tavern laughed coarsely, jeering and whistling and stamping their feet.
            </p>
            <p>"My faithful subjects," the pockmarked man replied with a gross smirk. "Drunks, thieves, and procurers. I
                bask in the warm glow of your love for me." His contempt seemed directed almost as much at himself as at
                the ragged, unwashed crowd.
            </p>
            <p>They whistled in unison and stamped their feet derisively. "How many tonight, Drosta?" someone shouted.
            </p>
            <p>"As many as I can." The king leered. "It's my duty to spread royal blessings wherever I go."</p>
            <p>"Is that what you call it?" someone else demanded raucously.</p>
            <p>"It's as good a name as any," Drosta replied with a shrug.</p>
            <p>"The royal bedchamber awaits," the tavern owner declaimed with a mocking bow.</p>
            <p>"Along with the royal bedbugs, I'm sure," Drosta added. "Ale for every man not too drunk to swill it
                down.
            </p>
            <p>Let my loyal subjects drink to my vitality."</p>
            <p>The crowd cheered as the king pushed toward a stairway leading to the upper storeys of the building. "My
                duty awaits me," he proclaimed, pointing with a grand gesture up the stairs. "Let all take note of how
                eagerly I go to embrace that stern responsibility." And he mounted the stairs to the derisive applause
                of the assembled riffraff.
            </p>
            <p>"What now?" Silk asked.</p>
            <p>"We'll wait a bit," Yarblek replied. "It would be a little obvious if we went up immediately."</p>
            <p>Garion shifted uncomfortably on the bench. A very faint, nervous kind of tingle had begun just behind his
                ears, a sort of prickling sensation that seemed to crawl over his skin. He had an unpleasant thought or
                two about the possibility of lice or fleas migrating from the scum in the tavern in search of fresh
                blood, but dismissed that idea. The tingling did not seem to be external.
            </p>
            <p>At a table not far away, a shabbily dressed man, apparently far gone in drink, had been snoring with his
                head buried in his arms. In the middle of a snore he raised his face briefly and winked. It was
                Belgarath. He let his face drop back onto his arms as a wave of relief swept through Garion.
            </p>
            <p>The drunken crowd in the tavern grew steadily more rowdy. A short, ugly fight broke out near the fire
                pit, and the revelers at first cheered, then joined in, kicking at the two who rolled about on the
                floor.
            </p>
            <p>"Let's go up," Yarblek said shortly, rising to his feet. He pushed through the crowd and started
                upstairs.
            </p>
            <p>"Grandfather's here," Garion whispered to Silk as they followed.</p>
            <p>"I saw him," Silk replied shortly.</p>
            <p>The stairs led to a dim upper hallway with dirty, threadbare carpeting on the floor. At the far end, King
                Drosta's two bored-looking guards leaned against the wall on either side of a solid door.
            </p>
            <p>"My name's Yarblek," Silk's friend told them as he reached the door. "Drosta's expecting me."</p>
            <p>The guards glanced at each other, then one tapped on the door. "That man you wanted to see is here, your
                Majesty."
            </p>
            <p>"Send him in." Drosta's voice was muffled.</p>
            <p>"He isn't alone," the guard advised.</p>
            <p>"That's all right."</p>
            <p>"Go ahead," the guard said to Yarblek, unlatching the door and pushing it open.</p>
            <p>The king of the Nadraks was sprawled on a rumpled bed with his arms about the thin shoulders of a pair of
                dirty, scantily dressed young girls with tangled hair and hopeless-looking eyes. "Yarblek," the depraved
                monarch greeted the merchant, "what kept you?"
            </p>
            <p>"I didn't want to attract attention by following you immediately, Drosta."</p>
            <p>"I almost got sidetracked." Drosta leered at the two girls. "Aren't they luscious?"</p>
            <p>"If you like the type." Yarblek shrugged. "I prefer a little more maturity."</p>
            <p>"That's good, too," Drosta admitted, "but I love them all. I fall in love twenty times a day. Run along,
                my pretties," he told the girls. "I've got some business to take care of just now. I'll send for you
                later."
            </p>
            <p>The two girls immediately left, closing the door quietly behind them. Drosta sat up on the bed,
                scratching absently at one armpit. His stained and rumpled yellow doublet was unbuttoned, and his bony
                chest was covered with coarse black hair. He was thin, almost emaciated, and his scrawny arms looked
                like two sticks. His hair was lank and greasy, and his beard was so thin that it was little more than a
                few scraggly-looking black hairs sprouting from his chin. The pockmarks on his face were deep, angry red
                scars, and his neck and hands were covered with an unwholesome, scabby-looking rash. There was a
                distinctly unpleasant odor about him. "Are you sure this is the man I want?" he asked Yarblek. Garion
                looked at the Nadrak King sharply. The coarseness had gone out of his voice, and his tone was incisive,
                direct, the tone of a man who was all business. Garion made a few quick mental adjustments. Drosta lek
                Thun was not at all what he seemed.
            </p>
            <p>"I've known him for years, Drosta," Yarblek replied. "This is Prince Kheldar of Drasnia. He's also known
                as Silk and sometimes Ambar of Kotu or Radek of Boktor. He's a thief, a swindler, and a spy. Aside from
                that, he's not too bad."
            </p>
            <p>"We are delighted to meet so famous a man," King Drosta declared. "Welcome, Prince Kheldar."</p>
            <p>"Your Majesty," Silk replied, bowing.</p>
            <p>"I'd have invited you to the palace," Drosta continued, "but I've got some house guests with the
                unfortunate habit of sticking their noses into my business." He laughed dryly. "Luckily, I found out
                very soon that Malloreans are a priggish race. They won't follow me into places like this, so we'll be
                able to talk freely."
            </p>
            <p>He looked around at the cheap, gaudy furnishings and red draperies with a sort of amused toleration.</p>
            <p>"Besides," he added, "I like it here."</p>
            <p>Garion stood with his back against the wall near the door, trying to remain as unobtrusive as possible,
                but Drosta's nervous eyes picked him out. "Can he be trusted?" the king demanded of Silk.
            </p>
            <p>"Completely," Silk assured him. "He's my apprentice. I'm teaching him the business."</p>
            <p>"Which business? Stealing or spying?"</p>
            <p>Silk shrugged. "It amounts to the same thing. Yarblek says you wanted to see me. I assume it has
                something to do with current matters rather than any past misunderstandings."
            </p>
            <p>"You're quick, Kheldar," Drosta replied approvingly. "I need your help and I'm willing to pay for it."
            </p>
            <p>Silk grinned. "I'm fond of the word pay."</p>
            <p>"So I've heard. Do you know what's going on here in Gar og Nadrak?" Drosta's eyes were penetrating, and
                his veneer of gross self indulgence had fallen completely away.
            </p>
            <p>"I am in the intelligence service, your Majesty," Silk pointed out. Drosta grunted, stood up, and went to
                a table where a decanter of wine and several glasses stood. "Drink?" he asked.
            </p>
            <p>"Why not?"</p>
            <p>Drosta filled four glasses, took one for himself and paced nervously about the room with an angry
                expression. "I don't need any of this, Kheldar," he burst out. "My family's spent generations -
                centuries -
            </p>
            <p>weaning Gar og Nadrak away from the domination of the Grolims. Now they're about to drag us back into
                howling barbarism again, and I don't have any choice but to go along with it. I've got a quarter of a
                million Malloreans roaming around at will inside my borders and an army I can't even count poised just
                to the south. If I raise so much as one word of protest, 'Zakath will crush my kingdom with one fist."
            </p>
            <p>"Would he really do that?" Silk asked, taking a chair at the table.</p>
            <p>"With just about as much emotion as you'd feel about swatting a fly," Drosta replied. "Have you ever met
                him?"
            </p>
            <p>Silk shook his head.</p>
            <p>"You're lucky," Drosta told him with a shudder. "Taur Urgas is a madman, but, much as I hate him, he's
                still human. 'Zakath is made out of ice. I've got to get in touch with Rhodar."
            </p>
            <p>"Ah," Silk said. "That's what this is all about, then."</p>
            <p>"You're a nice enough fellow, Kheldar," Drosta told him dryly, "but I wouldn't go to all this trouble
                just for the pleasure of your company. You've got to carry my message to Rhodar. I've tried to get word
                to him, but I can't catch up with him. He won't stay in one place long enough. How can a fat man move so
                cursed fast?"
            </p>
            <p>"He's deceptive," Silk said shortly. "Exactly what have you got in mind?"</p>
            <p>"An alliance," Drosta replied bluntly. "My back's against the wall. Either I ally myself with Rhodar, or
                I get swallowed up."
            </p>
            <p>Silk carefully set down his glass. "That's a very large suggestion, your Majesty. In the present
                situation, it's going to take a great deal of fast talking to arrange."
            </p>
            <p>"That's why I sent for you, Kheldar. We're staring the end of the world right in the face. You've got to
                get to Rhodar and persuade him to pull his army back from the Thull border. Make him stop this insanity
                before it goes too far."
            </p>
            <p>"Making my uncle do things is a little beyond my abilities, King Drosta," Silk replied carefully. "I'm
                flattered that you think I've got that much influence with him, but things have usually been the other
                way around between us."
            </p>
            <p>"Don't you understand what's going on, Kheldar?" King Drosta's voice was anguished, and he gesticulated
                almost wildly as he spoke. "Our only hope of survival lies in not giving the Murgos and the Malloreans
                any kind of reason to unite. We should work to stir up trouble between them, not to provide them with a
                common enemy. Taur Urgas and 'Zakath hate each other with a passion so intense that it's almost holy.
            </p>
            <p>There are more Murgos than grains of sand and more Malloreans than stars. The Grolims can babble their
                gibberish about the awakening of Torak until their tongues fall out, but Taur Urgas and 'Zakath have
                taken the field for just one reason - each of them wants to destroy the other and make himself overking
                of Angarak. They're headed directly toward a war of mutual extinction. We can be rid of both of them if
                we just don't interfere."
            </p>
            <p>"I think I see what you mean," Silk murmured.</p>
            <p>"'Zakath is ferrying his Malloreans across the Sea of the East to his staging area near Thull Zelik, and
                Taur Urgas has the southern Murgos massed near Rak Goska. Inevitably, they're going to move on each
                other.
            </p>
            <p>We've got to stay out of the way and let them fight. Make Rhodar pull back before he spoils
                everything."
            </p>
            <p>"Have you talked with the Thulls about this?" Silk asked.</p>
            <p>Drosta snorted with contempt. "What's the point? I've tried to explain this to King Gethell, but talking
                to him is like talking to a pile of manure. The Thulls are so afraid of the Grolims that all you have to
                do is mention Torak's name and they go all to pieces. Gethell's a Thull through and through. There's
                nothing between his ears but sand."
            </p>
            <p>"There's just one problem with all of this, Drosta," Silk told the agitated monarch. "I can't carry your
                message to King Rhodar."
            </p>
            <p>"Can't?" Drosta exploded. "What do you mean, you can't?"</p>
            <p>"My uncle and I aren't on the best of terms just now," Silk lied smoothly. "We had a little
                misunderstanding a few months ago, and about the first thing he'd do, if he saw me coming, is have me
                put in chains - and I'm almost certain things would go downhill from there."
            </p>
            <p>Drosta groaned. "We're all doomed then," he declared, seeming to slump in on himself. "You were my last
                hope."
            </p>
            <p>"Let me think a moment," Silk said. "We might be able to salvage something out of this yet." He stared at
                the floor, chewing absently on a fingernail as he turned the problem over in his mind. "I can't go," he
                concluded. "That's obvious. But that doesn't mean that somebody else couldn't."
            </p>
            <p>"Who else would Rhodar trust?" Drosta demanded.</p>
            <p>Silk turned to Yarblek, who had been listening to the conversation intently with a worried frown. "Are
                you in any kind of trouble in Drasnia at the moment?" he asked.
            </p>
            <p>"Not that I know of."</p>
            <p>"All right," Silk continued. "There's a fur dealer in Boktor. Geldahar's his name."</p>
            <p>"Fat man? Sort of cross-eyed?" Yarblek asked.</p>
            <p>"That's him. Why don't you take a shipment of furs and go to Boktor? While you're trying to sell Geldahar
                the furs, tell him that the salmon run is late this year."
            </p>
            <p>"I'm sure he'll be fascinated to hear that."</p>
            <p>"It's a code-word," Silk explained with exaggerated patience. "As soon as you say that, he'll see to it
                that you get into the palace to see Queen Porenn."
            </p>
            <p>"I've heard that she's a lovely woman," Yarblek said, "but that's a long trip just to see a pretty girl.
                I can probably find a pretty girl just down the hall."
            </p>
            <p>"You're missing the point, Yarblek," Silk told him. "Porenn is Rhodar's queen, and he trusts her even
                more than he used to trust me. She'll know that I sent you, and she'll pass anything you tell her on to
                my uncle.
            </p>
            <p>Rhodar will be reading Drosta's message three days after you ride into Boktor. I guarantee it."</p>
            <p>"You'd let a woman know about all this?" Drosta objected violently. "Kheldar, you're insane. The only
                woman safe with a secret is one who's had her tongue cut out."
            </p>
            <p>Silk shook his head firmly. "Porenn's in control of Drasnian intelligence right now, Drosta. She already
                knows most of the secrets in the world. You're never going to get an emissary through an Alorn army to
                Rhodar, so forget that. There'll be Chereks with him, and they'll kill any Angarak on sight. If you want
                to communicate with Rhodar, you're going to have to use Drasnian intelligence as an intermediary, and
                that means going through Porenn."
            </p>
            <p>Drosta looked dubious. "Maybe," he concluded after a moment's thought. "I'll try anything at this point
                -
            </p>
            <p>but why should Yarblek get involved? Why can't you carry my message to the Drasnian queen?"</p>
            <p>Silk looked a trifle pained. "That wouldn't be a good idea at all, I'm afraid," he replied. "Porenn was
                rather central to my difficulties with my uncle. I'm definitely unwelcome at the palace just now."
            </p>
            <p>One of King Drosta's shaggy eyebrows shot up. "So that's the way it is." He laughed. "Your reputation's
                well-earned, I see." He turned to Yarblek. "It's up to you, then. Make the necessary arrangements for
                the trip to Boktor."
            </p>
            <p>"You already owe me money, Drosta," Yarblek replied bluntly, "the reward for bringing in Kheldar,
                remember?"
            </p>
            <p>Drosta shrugged. "Write it down someplace."</p>
            <p>Yarblek shook his head stubbornly. "Not hardly. Let's keep your account current. You're known as a slow
                payer, once you've got what you want."
            </p>
            <p>"Yarblek," Drosta said plaintively, "I'm your king."</p>
            <p>Yarblek inclined his head somewhat mockingly. "I honor and respect your Majesty," he said, "but business
                is business, after all."
            </p>
            <p>"I don't carry that much money with me," Drosta protested.</p>
            <p>"That's all right, Drosta. I can wait." Yarblek crossed his arms and sat down in a large chair with the
                air of a man planning to stay for quite some time.
            </p>
            <p>The king of the Nadraks stared at him helplessly.</p>
            <p>Then the door opened and Belgarath stepped into the room, still dressed in the rags he had worn in the
                tavern downstairs. There was no furtiveness about his entrance, and he moved like a man on serious
                business.
            </p>
            <p>"What is this?" Drosta exclaimed incredulously. "Guards!" he bawled, "get this drunken old man out of
                here."
            </p>
            <p>"They're asleep, Drosta," Belgarath replied calmly. "Don't be too harsh with them, though. It's not their
                fault." He closed the door.
            </p>
            <p>"Who are you? What do you think you're doing?" Drosta demanded. "Get out of here!"</p>
            <p>"I think you'd better take a closer look, Drosta," Silk advised with a dry little chuckle. "Appearances
                can be deceiving sometimes, and you shouldn't be so quick to try to throw somebody out. He might have
                something important to say to you."
            </p>
            <p>"Do you know him, Kheldar?" Drosta asked.</p>
            <p>"Just about everybody in the world knows him," Silk replied. "Or of him."</p>
            <p>Drosta's face creased into a puzzled frown, but Yarblek had started from his chair, his lean face
                suddenly pale. "Drosta!" he gasped. "Look at him. Think a minute. You know who he is."
            </p>
            <p>Drosta stared at the shabby-looking old man, and his bulging eyes slowly opened even wider. "You!" he
                blurted.
            </p>
            <p>Yarblek was still gaping at Belgarath. "He's been involved in it from the very beginning. I should have
                put it together down in Cthol Murgos - him, the woman, all of it."
            </p>
            <p>"What are you doing in Gar og Nadrak?" Drosta asked in an awed voice.</p>
            <p>"Just passing through, Drosta," Belgarath replied. "If you're quite finished with your discussion here, I
                need these two Alorns. We have an appointment, and we're running a little behind schedule."
            </p>
            <p>"I always thought you were a myth."</p>
            <p>"I like to encourage that as much as I can," Belgarath told him. "It makes moving around a lot easier."
            </p>
            <p>"Are you mixed up in what the Alorns are doing?"</p>
            <p>"They're acting more or less on my suggestions, yes. Polgara's keeping an eye on them."</p>
            <p>"Can you get word to them and tell them to disengage?"</p>
            <p>"That won't really be necessary, Drosta. I wouldn't worry too much about 'Zakath and Taur Urgas, if I
                were you. There are more important things afoot than their squabbles."
            </p>
            <p>"So that's what Rhodar's doing," Drosta said in sudden comprehension. "Is it really that late?"</p>
            <p>"It's even later than you think," the old sorcerer answered. He crossed to the table and poured himself
                some of Drosta's wine. "Torak's already stirring, and the whole matter's likely to be settled before the
                snow flies."
            </p>
            <p>"This is going too far, Belgarath," Drosta said. "I might try to maneuver my way around Taur Urgas and
            </p>
            <p>'Zakath, but I'm not going to cross Torak." He turned decisively toward the door.</p>
            <p>"Don't do anything rash, Drosta," Belgarath advised him calmly, sitting in a chair and taking a sip of
                his wine. "Grolims can be most unreasonable, and the fact that I'm here in Yar Nadrak could only be
                viewed as the result of some collusion on your part. They'd have you bent backward over an altar and
                your heart sizzling in the coals before you ever got the chance to explain - king or no king."
            </p>
            <p>Drosta froze in his tracks, his pockmarked face going very pale. For a moment, he seemed to be struggling
                with himself. Then his shoulders slumped and his resolution seemed to wilt. "You've got me by the
                throat, haven't you, Belgarath?" he said with a short laugh. "You've managed to make me outsmart myself,
                and now you're going to use that to force me to betray the God of Angarak."
            </p>
            <p>"Are you really all that fond of him?"</p>
            <p>"Nobody's fond of Torak. I'm afraid of him, and that's a better reason to stay on the good side of him
                than any sentimental attachment. If he wakes up-" The king of the Nadraks shuddered.
            </p>
            <p>"Have you ever given much thought to the kind of world we'd have if he didn't exist?" Belgarath
                suggested.
            </p>
            <p>"That's too much to even wish for. He's a God. No one could hope to 'defeat him. He's too powerful for
                that."
            </p>
            <p>"There are things more powerful than Gods, Drosta - two that I can think of offhand, and those two are
                rushing toward a final meeting. It probably wouldn't be a good idea to put yourself between them at this
                point."
            </p>
            <p>But something else had occurred to Drosta. He turned slowly with a look of stunned incredulity and stared
                directly at Garion. He shook his head and wiped at his eyes, like a man trying to clear away a fog.
                Garion
            </p>
            <p>became painfully aware of the great sword strapped across his back. Drosta's bulging eyes widened even
                more as the realization of what he was seeing erased the Orb's suggestion that his brain not record what
                stood in plain sight before him. His expression became awed, and desperate hope dawned on his ugly face.
            </p>
            <p>"Your Majesty," he stammered, bowing with profound respect. "</p>
            <p>"Your Majesty," Garion replied, politely inclining his head.</p>
            <p>"It looks as if I'm forced to wish you good luck," Drosta said in a quiet voice. "Despite what Belgarath
                says, I think you're going to need it."
            </p>
            <p>"Thank you, King Drosta," Garion said.</p>
        </chapter>
        <chapter number="6">
            <p>"DO YOU THINK we can trust Drosta?" Garion asked Silk as they followed Belgarath along the
                garbage-littered alley behind the tavern.
            </p>
            <p>"Probably about as far as we could throw him," Silk replied. "He was honest about one thing though. His
                back's to the wall. That might make him bargain with Rhodar in good faith - initially at least."
            </p>
            <p>When they reached the street at the end of the alley, Belgarath glanced up once at the evening sky. "We'd
                better hurry," he said. "I want to get out of the city before they close the gates. I left our horses in
                a thicket a mile or so outside the walls."
            </p>
            <p>"You went back for them?" Silk sounded a little surprised.</p>
            <p>"Of course I did. I don't plan to walk all the way to Morindland." He led them up the street away from
                the river.
            </p>
            <p>They reached the city gates in fading light just as the guards were preparing to close them for the
                night.
            </p>
            <p>One of the Nadrak soldiers raised his hand as if to bar their way, then apparently changed his mind and
                motioned them through irritably, muttering curses under his breath. The huge, tar-smeared gate boomed
                shut behind them, and there was the clinking rattle of heavy chains from inside as the bolts were thrown
                and locked. Garion glanced up once at the carved face of Torak which brooded down at them from above the
                gate, then deliberately turned his back.
            </p>
            <p>"Are we likely to be followed?" Silk asked Belgarath as they walked along the dirt highway leading away
                from the city.
            </p>
            <p>"I wouldn't be very surprised," Belgarath replied. "Drosta knows - or suspects - a great deal about what
                we're doing. Mallorean Grolims are very subtle, and they can pick the thoughts out of his head without
                his knowing it. That's probably why they don't bother to follow him when he goes off on his little
                excursions."
            </p>
            <p>"Shouldn't you take some steps?" Silk suggested as they moved through the gathering twilight.</p>
            <p>"We're getting a bit too close to Mallorea to be making unnecessary noise," Belgarath told him. "Zedar
                can hear me moving around from a long way off, and Torak's only dozing now. I'd rather not take the
                chance of waking him up with any more loud clatter."
            </p>
            <p>They walked along the highway toward the shadowy line of rank undergrowth at the edge of the open fields
                surrounding the city. The sound of frogs from the marshy ground near the river was very loud in the
                twilight.
            </p>
            <p>"Torak isn't really asleep any more then?" Garion asked finally. He had harbored somewhere at the back of
                his mind the vague hope that they might be able to creep up on the sleeping God and catch him unaware.
            </p>
            <p>"No, not really,'' his grandfather replied. "The sound of your hand touching the Orb shook the whole
                world.
            </p>
            <p>Not even Torak could sleep through that. He isn't really awake yet, but he's not entirely asleep,
                either."
            </p>
            <p>"Did it really make all that much noise?" Silk asked curiously.</p>
            <p>"They probably heard it on the other side of the universe. I left the horses over there." The old man
                pointed toward a shadowy willow grove several hundred yards to the left of the road.
            </p>
            <p>From behind them there was the rattle of a heavy chain, startling the frogs into momentary silence.</p>
            <p>"They're opening the gate," Silk said. "They wouldn't do that unless somebody gave them an official
                reason to."
            </p>
            <p>"Let's hurry," Belgarath said.</p>
            <p>The horses stirred and nickered as the three of them pushed their way through the rustling willows in the
                rapidly descending darkness. They led the horses out of the grove, mounted, and rode back toward the
                highway.
            </p>
            <p>"They know we're out here somewhere," Belgarath said. "There's not much point being coy about it."</p>
            <p>"Just a second," Silk said. He dismounted and rummaged through one of the canvas bags tied to their
                packhorse. He pulled something out of the bag, then climbed back on his horse. "Let's go then."
            </p>
            <p>They pushed into a gallop, thudding along the dirt road under a starry, moonless sky toward the denser
                shadows where the forest rose at the edge of the scrubby, burned-off expanse surrounding the Nadrak
                capital.
            </p>
            <p>"Can you see them?" Belgarath called to Silk, who was bringing up the rear and looking back over his
                shoulder.
            </p>
            <p>"I think so," Silk shouted back. "They're about a mile behind."</p>
            <p>"That's too close."</p>
            <p>"I'll take care of it as soon as we get into the woods," Silk replied confidently.</p>
            <p>The dark forest loomed closer and closer as they galloped along the hard-packed road. Garion could smell
                the trees now.
            </p>
            <p>They plunged into the black shadows under the trees and felt that slight extra warmth that always lies in
                a forest. Silk reined in sharply. "Keep going," he told them, swinging out of his saddle. "I'll catch
                up."
            </p>
            <p>Belgarath and Garion rode on, slowing a bit in order to pick the road out of the darkness. After several
                minutes, Silk caught up with them. "Listen," the little man said, pulling his horse to a stop. His teeth
                flashed in the shadows as he grinned.
            </p>
            <p>"They're coming," Garion warned urgently as he heard a rumble of hoofs. "Hadn't we better-"</p>
            <p>"Listen," Silk whispered sharply.</p>
            <p>From behind there were several startled exclamations and the heavy sound of men falling. A horse squealed
                and ran off somewhere.
            </p>
            <p>Silk laughed wickedly. "I think we can press on," he said gaily. "They'll be delayed for a bit while they
                round up their horses."
            </p>
            <p>"What did you do?" Garion asked him.</p>
            <p>Silk shrugged. "I stretched a rope across the road, about chest-high on a mounted man. It's an old trick,
                but sometimes old tricks are the best. They'll have to be cautious now, so we should be able to lose
                them by morning."
            </p>
            <p>"Let's go, then," Belgarath said.</p>
            <p>"Where are we headed?" Silk asked as they moved into a canter.</p>
            <p>"We'll make directly for the north range," the old man replied. "Too many people know we're here, so
                let's get to the land of the Morindim as soon as we can."
            </p>
            <p>"If they're really after us, they'll follow us all the way, won't they?" Garion asked, looking back
                nervously.
            </p>
            <p>"I don't think so," Belgarath told him. "They'll be a long way behind by the time we get there. I don't
                think they'll risk going into Morind territory just to follow a cold trail."
            </p>
            <p>"Is it that dangerous, Grandfather?"</p>
            <p>"The Morindim do nasty things to strangers if they catch them."</p>
            <p>Garion thought about that. "Won't we be strangers too?" he asked. "To the Morindim, I mean?"</p>
            <p>"I'll take care of that when we get there."</p>
            <p>They galloped on through the remainder of the velvety night, leaving their now-cautious pursuers far
                behind. The blackness beneath the trees was dotted with the pale, winking glow of fireflies, and
                crickets chirped interminably. As the first light of morning began to filter through the forest, they
                reached the edge of another burned-off area, and Belgarath reined in to peer cautiously out at the rank
                scrub, dotted here and there with charred snags. "We'd better have something to eat," he suggested. "The
                horses need some rest, and we can catch a bit of sleep before we go on." He looked around in the
                gradually increasing light. "Let's get away from the road, though." He turned his horse and led them off
                along the edge of the burn. After several hundred yards, they reached a small clearing that jutted out
                into the coarse brush. A spring trickled water into a mossy pool at the very edge of the trees, and the
                grass in the clearing was intensely green. The outer edge of the opening was hemmed in by brambles and a
                tangle of charred limbs. "This looks like a good place," Belgarath decided.
            </p>
            <p>"Not really," Silk disagreed. He was staring at a crudely squared-off block of stone standing in the
                center of the clearing. There were ugly black stains running down the sides of the stone.
            </p>
            <p>"For our purposes it is," the old man replied. "The altars of Torak are generally avoided, and we don't
                particularly want company." They dismounted at the edge of the trees, and Belgarath began rummaging
                through one of the packs for bread and dried meat. Garion was in a curiously abstracted mood. He was
                tired, and his weariness made him a bit light-headed. Quite deliberately, he walked across the springy
                turf to the bloodstained altar; he stared at it, his eyes meticulously recording details without
                considering their implication. The blackened stone sat solidly in the center of the clearing, casting no
                shadow in the pale dawn light. It was an old altar, and had not been used recently. The stains that had
                sunk into the pores of the rock were black with age, and the bones littering the ground around it were
                half sunk in the earth and were covered with a greenish patina of moss. A scurrying spider darted into
                the vacant eye socket of a mossy skull, seeking refuge in the dark, vaulted emptiness. Many of the bones
                were broken and showed the marks of the small, sharp teeth of forest scavengers who would feed on
                anything that was dead. A cheap, tarnished silver brooch lay with its chain tangled about a lumpy
                vertebra, and not far away a brass buckle, green with verdigris, still clung to a bit of moldering
                leather.
            </p>
            <p>"Come away from that thing, Garion," Silk told him with a note of revulsion in his voice.</p>
            <p>"It sort of helps to look at it," Garion replied quite calmly, still staring at the altar and the bones.
                "It gives me something to think about beside being afraid." He squared his shoulders, and his great
                sword shifted on his back. "I don't really think the world needs this sort of thing. Maybe it's time
                somebody did something about it."
            </p>
            <p>When he turned around, Belgarath was looking at him, his wise old eyes narrowed. "It's a start," the
                sorcerer observed. "Let's eat and get some sleep."
            </p>
            <p>They took a quick breakfast, picketed their horses, and rolled themselves in their blankets under some
                bushes at the edge of the clearing. Not even the presence of the Grolim altar nor the peculiar resolve
                it had stirred in him was enough to keep Garion from falling asleep immediately.
            </p>
            <p>It was almost noon when he awoke, pulled from sleep by a faint whispering sound in his mind. He sat up
                quickly, looking around to find the source of that disturbance, but neither the forest nor the
                brushchoked burn seemed to hold any threat. Belgarath stood not far away, looking up at the summer sky
                where a large, blue-banded hawk was circling.
            </p>
            <p>"What are you doing here?" The old sorcerer did not speak aloud but rather cast the question at the sky
                with his mind. The hawk spiraled down to the clearing, flared his wings to avoid the altar, and landed
                on the turf. He looked directly at Belgarath with fierce yellow eyes, then shimmered and seemed to blur.
                When the shimmering was gone, the misshapen sorcerer Beldin stood in his place. He was still as ragged,
                dirty, and irritable as he had been the last time Garion had seen him.
            </p>
            <p>"Is this all the farther you've managed to come?" he demanded harshly of Belgarath. "What have you been
                doing - stopping at every tavern along the way?"
            </p>
            <p>"We ran into a small delay," Belgarath replied calmly.</p>
            <p>Beldin grunted with a sour look. "If you keep dawdling along like this, it will take you the rest of the
                year to get to Cthol Mishrak."
            </p>
            <p>"We'll get there, Beldin. You worry too much."</p>
            <p>"Somebody has to. You're being followed, you know."</p>
            <p>"How far back are they?"</p>
            <p>"Five leagues or so."</p>
            <p>Belgarath shrugged. "That's far enough. They'll give up when we get to Morindland."</p>
            <p>"What if they don't?"</p>
            <p>"Have you been spending time with Polgara lately?" Belgarath asked dryly. "I thought I'd gotten away from
                all the 'what-ifs."'
            </p>
            <p>Beldin shrugged, a gesture made grotesque by the hump on his back. "I saw her last week," he reported.
            </p>
            <p>"She has some interesting plans for you, you know."</p>
            <p>"She came to the Vale?" Belgarath sounded surprised.</p>
            <p>"Passed through. She was with the red-haired girl's army."</p>
            <p>Garion threw off his blanket. "With whose army?" he demanded.</p>
            <p>"What's going on down there?" Belgarath asked sharply.</p>
            <p>Beldin scratched at his tangled hair. "I never really got the straight of it," he admitted. "All I know
                is that the Alorns are following that little redheaded Tolnedran. She calls herself the Rivan Queen -
                whatever that means."
            </p>
            <p>"Ce'Nedra?" Garion was incredulous, though, for some reason, he knew that he shouldn't be.</p>
            <p>"I guess she went through Arendia like a pestilence," Beldin continued. "After she passed, there wasn't
                an able-bodied man left in the kingdom. Then she went on down into Tolnedra and goaded her father into
                convulsions - I didn't know that he was subject to fits."
            </p>
            <p>"It crops up in the Borune line once in a while," Belgarath said. "It's nothing all that serious, but
                they try to keep it quiet."
            </p>
            <p>"Anyway," the hunchback went on, "while Ran Borune was still frothing at the mouth, his daughter stole
                his legions. She's persuaded about half the world to take up arms and follow her." He gave Garion a
                quizzical look. "You're supposed to marry her, aren't you?"
            </p>
            <p>Garion nodded, not trusting himself to speak.</p>
            <p>Beldin grinned suddenly. "You might want to give some thought to running away."</p>
            <p>"Ce'Nedra?" Garion blurted again.</p>
            <p>"His wits seem a bit scrambled," Beldin observed.</p>
            <p>"He's been under a strain, and his nerves aren't too good just now," Belgarath replied. "Are you going
                back to the Vale?"
            </p>
            <p>Beldin nodded. "The twins and I are going to join Polgara when the campaign starts. She might need some
                help if the Grolims come at her in force."
            </p>
            <p>"Campaign?" Belgarath exclaimed. "What campaign? I told them just to march up and down and make a lot of
                noise. I specifically told them not to invade."
            </p>
            <p>"They ignored you, it seems. Alorns aren't noted for restraint in such matters. Apparently they got
                together and decided to take steps. The fat one seems fairly intelligent. He wants to get a Cherek fleet
                into the Sea of the East to commit a few constructive atrocities on Mallorean shipping. The rest of it
                seems to be pretty much diversionary."
            </p>
            <p>Belgarath started to swear. "You can't let them out of your sight for a single instant," he raged. "How
                could Polgara lend herself to this idiocy?"
            </p>
            <p>"The plan does have a certain merit, Belgarath. The more Malloreans they drown now, the fewer we have to
                fight later."
            </p>
            <p>"We never planned to fight them, Beldin. The Angaraks won't unite unless Torak comes back to weld them
                together again - or unless they're faced with a common enemy. We just talked with Drosta lek Thun, the
                Nadrak King, and he's so sure that the Murgos and the Malloreans are about to go to war with each other
                that he wants to ally himself with the west just to get clear of it. When you get back, see if you can
                talk some sense into Rhodar and Anheg. I've got enough problems already."
            </p>
            <p>"Your problems are only starting, Belgarath. The twins had a visitation a couple of days ago."</p>
            <p>"A what?"</p>
            <p>Beldin shrugged. "What else would you call it? They were working on something - quite unrelated to all
                this - and the pair of them suddenly went into a trance and began to babble at me. At first they were
                just repeating that gibberish from the Mrin Codex - you know the place - where the Mrin Prophet's mind
                broke down and he degenerated into animal noises for a while. Anyway, they went back over that part -
                only this time it came out coherently."
            </p>
            <p>"What did they say?" Belgarath demanded, his eyes burning.</p>
            <p>"Are you sure you want to know?"</p>
            <p>"Of course I want to know."</p>
            <p>"All right. It went like this: 'Behold, the heart of the stone shall relent, and the beauty that was
                destroyed shall be restored, and the eye that is not shall be made whole again."'
            </p>
            <p>Belgarath stared at him. "That's it?" he asked.</p>
            <p>"That's it," Beldin told him.</p>
            <p>"But what does it mean?" Garion asked.</p>
            <p>"Just what it says, Belgarion," Beldin replied. "For some reason the Orb is going to restore Torak."</p>
            <p>Garion began to tremble as the full impact of Beldin's words struck him. "Torak's going to win, then," he
                said numbly.
            </p>
            <p>"It didn't say anything about winning or losing, Belgarion," Beldin corrected him. "All it said was that
                the Orb is going to undo what it did to Torak when he used it to crack the world. It doesn't say
                anything about why."
            </p>
            <p>"That's always been the trouble with the Prophecy," Belgarath observed. "It can mean any one of a dozen
                different things."
            </p>
            <p>"Or all of them," Beldin added. "That's what makes it so difficult to understand sometimes. We tend to
                concentrate on just one thing, but Prophecy includes everything at the same time. I'll work on it and
                see if I can wring some sense out of it. If I come up with anything, I'll let you know. I'd better be
                getting back." He leaned slightly forward and curled his arms out in a vaguely winglike gesture. "Watch
                out for the Morindim," he told Belgarath. "You're a fair sorcerer, but magic's altogether different, and
                sometimes it gets away from you."
            </p>
            <p>"I think I can handle it if I have to," Belgarath replied tartly.</p>
            <p>"Maybe," Beldin said. "If you can manage to stay sober." He shimmered back into the form of the hawk,
                beat his wings twice, and spiraled up out of the clearing and into the sky. Garion watched him until he
                was only a circling speck.
            </p>
            <p>"That was a strange visit," Silk said, rolling out of his blankets. "It looks as if quite a bit's been
                going on since we left."
            </p>
            <p>"And none of it very good," Belgarath added sourly. "Let's get moving. We're really going to have to
                hurry now. If Anheg gets his fleet into the Sea of the East and starts sinking Mallorean troop ships,
                'Zakath might decide to march north and come across the land bridge. If we don't get there first, it
                could get very crowded up there." The old man scowled darkly. "I'd like to put my hands on your uncle
                just about now," he added.
            </p>
            <p>"I'd sweat a few pounds off him."</p>
            <p>They quickly saddled their horses and rode back along the edge of the sunlit forest toward the road
                leading north.
            </p>
            <p>Despite the rather lame assurances of the two sorcerers, Garion rode slumped in despair. They were going
                to lose, and Torak was going to kill him.
            </p>
            <p>"Stop feeling sa sorry for yourself, " the inner voice told him finally.</p>
            <p>"Why did you get me into this?" Garion demanded bitterly.</p>
            <p>"We've discussed that before. "</p>
            <p>"He's going to kill me."</p>
            <p>"What gives you that idea?"</p>
            <p>"That's what the Prophecy said." Garion stopped abruptly as a thought occurred to him. "You said it
                yourself. You're the Prophecy, aren't you?"
            </p>
            <p>"It's a misleading term-,and I didn't say anything about winning or losing. "</p>
            <p>"Isn't that what it means?"</p>
            <p>"No. It means exactly what it says."</p>
            <p>"What else could it mean?"</p>
            <p>"You're getting more stubborn every day. Stop worrying so much about meanings and just do what you have
                to do. You almost had it right, back there. "
            </p>
            <p>"If all you're going to do is talk in riddles, why bother with it at all? Why go to all the trouble of
                saying things that nobody's able to understand?"
            </p>
            <p>"Because it's necessary to say it. The word determines the event. The word puts limits on the event and
                shapes it. Without the word, the event is merely a random happening. That's the whole purpose of what
                you call prophecy - to separate the significant from the random. "
            </p>
            <p>"I don't understand."</p>
            <p>"I didn't think you would, but you asked, after all. Now stop worrying about it. It has nothing to do
                with you."
            </p>
            <p>Garion wanted to protest, but the voice was gone. The conversation, however, had made him feel a little
                better - not much, but a little. To take his mind off it, he pulled his horse in beside Belgarath's as
                they reentered the forest on the far side of the burn. "Exactly who are the Morindim, Grandfather?" he
                asked.
            </p>
            <p>"Everybody keeps talking about them as if they were terribly dangerous."</p>
            <p>"They are," Belgarath replied, "but you can get through their country if you're careful."</p>
            <p>"Are they on Torak's side?"</p>
            <p>"The Morindim aren't on anybody's side. They don't even live in the same world with us."</p>
            <p>"I don't follow that."</p>
            <p>"The Morindim are like the Ulgos used to be - before UL accepted them. There were several groups of
                Godless Ones. They all wandered off in various directions. The Ulgos went to the west, the Morindim went
                north. Other groups went south or east and disappeared."
            </p>
            <p>"Why didn't they just stay where they were?"</p>
            <p>"They couldn't. There's a kind of compulsion involved in the decisions of the Gods. Anyway, the Ulgos
                finally found themselves a God. The Morindim didn't. The compulsion to remain separated from other
                people is still there. They live in that treeless emptiness up there beyond the north range - small
                nomadic bands, mostly."
            </p>
            <p>"What did you mean when you said that they don't live in the same world with us?"</p>
            <p>"The world is a pretty terrible place for a Morind - a demon-haunted place. They worship devils and they
                live more in dreams than they do in reality. Their society is dominated by the dreamers and the
                magicians."
            </p>
            <p>"There aren't really any devils, are there?" Garion asked skeptically.</p>
            <p>"Oh, yes. The devils are very real."</p>
            <p>"Where do they come from?"</p>
            <p>Belgarath shrugged. "I haven't any idea. They do exist, though, and they're completely evil. The Morindim
                control them by the use of magic."
            </p>
            <p>"Magic? Is that different from what we do?"</p>
            <p>"Quite a bit. We're sorcerers - at least that's what we're called. What we do involves the Will and the
                Word, but that's not the only way to do things."
            </p>
            <p>"I don't quite follow."</p>
            <p>"It's not really all that complicated, Garion. There are several ways to tamper with the normal order of
                things. Vordai's a witch. What she does involves the use of spirits - usually benign, mischievous
                sometimes
            </p>
            <p>- but not actually wicked. A magician uses devils - evil spirits."</p>
            <p>"Isn't that sort of dangerous?"</p>
            <p>Belgarath nodded. "Very dangerous," he replied. "The magician tries to control the demon with spells -
            </p>
            <p>formulas, incantations, symbols, mystic diagrams - that sort of thing. As long as he doesn't make any
                mistakes, the demon is his absolute slave and has to do what he tells it to do. The demon doesn't want
                to be a slave, so it keeps looking for a way to break the spell."
            </p>
            <p>"What happens if it does?"</p>
            <p>"It generally devours the magician on the spot. That happens rather frequently. If you lose your
                concentration or summon a demon too strong for you, you're in trouble."
            </p>
            <p>"What did Beldin mean when he said that you weren't very good at magic?" Silk asked.</p>
            <p>"I've never spent that much time trying to learn about it," the old sorcerer replied. "I have
                alternatives, after all, and magic is dangerous and not very dependable."
            </p>
            <p>"Don't use it then," Silk suggested.</p>
            <p>"I hadn't really planned to. Usually the threat of magic is enough to keep the Morindim at a distance.
                Actual confrontations are rather rare."
            </p>
            <p>"I can see why."</p>
            <p>"After we get through the north range, we'll disguise ourselves. There are a number of markings and
                symbols that will make the Morindim avoid us."
            </p>
            <p>"That sounds promising."</p>
            <p>"Of course we have to get there first," the old man pointed out. "Let's pick up the pace a bit. We've
                still got a long way to go." And he pushed his horse into a gallop.
            </p>
        </chapter>
        <chapter number="7">
            <p>THEY RODE HARD for the better part of a week, moving steadily northward and avoiding the scattered
                settlements which dotted the Nadrak forest. Garion noticed that the nights grew steadily shorter; by the
                time they reached the foothills of the north range, darkness had virtually disappeared. Evening and
                morning merged into a few hours of luminous twilight as the sun dipped briefly below the horizon before
                bursting into view once more.
            </p>
            <p>The north range marked the upper edge of the Nadrak forest. It was not so much a mountainous region as it
                was a string of peaks, a long finger of upthrusting terrain reaching out toward the east from the broad
                ranges that formed the spine of the continent. As they rode up a scarcely defined trail toward a saddle
                that stretched between two snowy peaks, the trees around them grew more stunted and finally disappeared
                entirely. Beyond that point, there would be no more trees. Belgarath stopped at the edge of one of these
                last groves and cut a half dozen long saplings.
            </p>
            <p>The wind that came down off the peaks had a bitter chill to it and the arid smell of perpetual winter.
                When they reached the boulder-strewn summit, Garion looked out for the first time at the immense plain
                stretching below. The plain, unmarked by trees, was covered with tall grass that bent before the vagrant
                wind in long, undulating waves. Rivers wandered aimlessly across that emptiness, and a thousand shallow
                lakes and ponds scattered, blue and glistening under a northern sun, toward the horizon.
            </p>
            <p>"How far does it reach?" Garion asked quietly.</p>
            <p>"From here to the polar ice," Belgarath replied. "Several hundred leagues."</p>
            <p>"And no one lives out there but the Morindim?"</p>
            <p>"Nobody wants to. For most of the year, it's buried in snow and darkness. You can go for six months up
                here without ever seeing the sun."
            </p>
            <p>They rode down the rocky slope toward the plain and found a lowroofed, shallow cave at the base of the
                granite cliff that seemed to be the demarcation line between the mountains and the foothills. "We'll
                stop here for a while," Belgarath told them, reining in his tired mount. "We've got some preparations to
                make, and the horses need some rest."
            </p>
            <p>They were all kept quite busy for the next several days while Belgarath radically altered their
                appearances.
            </p>
            <p>Silk set crude traps among the maze of rabbit runs twisting through the tall grass, and Garion roamed the
                foothills in search of certain tuberous roots and a peculiar smelling white flower. Belgarath sat at the
                mouth of the cave, fashioning various implements from his saplings. The roots Garion had gathered
                yielded a dark brown stain, and Belgarath carefully applied it to their skins. "The Morindim are
                dark-skinned," he explained as he sat painting Silk's arms and back with the stain. "Somewhat darker
                than Tolnedrans or Nyissans. This will wear off after a few weeks, but it will last long enough to get
                us through."
            </p>
            <p>After he had stained all their skins into swarthiness, he crushed the odd-smelling flowers to produce a
                jet black ink. "Silk's hair is the right color already," he said, "and mine will get by, but Garion's
                just won't do."
            </p>
            <p>He diluted some of the ink with water and dyed Garion's sandy hair black. "That's better," he grunted
                when he had finished, "and there's enough left for the tattoos."
            </p>
            <p>"Tattoos?" Garion asked, startled at the thought.</p>
            <p>"The Morindim decorate themselves extensively."</p>
            <p>"Will it hurt?"</p>
            <p>"We're not really going to tattoo ourselves, Garion," Belgarath told him with a pained look. "They take
                too long to heal. Besides, I'm afraid your Aunt would go into hysterics if I took you back to her with
                designs engraved all over you. This ink will last long enough for us to get through Morindland. It will
                wear off-eventually."
            </p>
            <p>Silk was sitting cross-legged in front of the cave, looking for all the world like a tailor as he sewed
                fresh rabbit pelts to their clothing.
            </p>
            <p>"Won't they start to smell after a few days?" Garion asked, wrinkling his nose.</p>
            <p>"Probably," Silk admitted, "but I don't have time to cure the pelts." Later, as Belgarath was carefully
                drawing the tattoos on their faces, he explained the guise they were going to assume. "Garion will be
                the quester," he said.
            </p>
            <p>"What's that?" Garion asked.</p>
            <p>"Don't move your face," Belgarath told him, frowning as he drew lines under Garion's eyes with a
                raven-feather quill. "The quest is a Morind ritual. It's customary for a young Morind of a certain rank
                to undertake a quest before he assumes a position of authority in his clan. You'll wear a white fur
                headband and carry that red spear I fixed up for you. It's ceremonial," he cautioned, "so don't try to
                stab anybody with it. That's very bad form."
            </p>
            <p>"I'll remember that."</p>
            <p>"We'll disguise your sword to look like some sort of relic or something. A magician might see past the
                Orb's suggestion that it's not there - depending on how good he is. One other thing - the quester is
                absolutely forbidden to speak under any circumstances, so keep your mouth shut. Silk will be your
                dreamer. He'll wear a white fur band on his left arm. Dreamers speak in riddles and gibberish for the
                most part, and they tend to fall into trances and have fits." He glanced over at Silk. "Do you think you
                can handle that?"
            </p>
            <p>"Trust me," Silk replied, grinning.</p>
            <p>"Not very likely," Belgarath grunted. "I'll be Garion's magician. I'll carry a staff with a horned skull
                on it that will make most Morindim avoid us."
            </p>
            <p>"Most?" Silk asked quickly.</p>
            <p>"It's considered bad manners to interfere with a quest, but it happens now and then." The old man looked
                critically at Garion's tattoos. "Good enough," he said and turned to Silk with his quill.
            </p>
            <p>When it was all done, the three of them were scarcely recognizable. The markings the old man had
                carefully drawn on their arms and faces were not pictures so much as they were designs. Their faces had
                been changed into hideous devil masks, and the exposed parts of their bodies were covered with symbols
                etched in black ink. They wore fur-covered trousers and vests and bone necklaces clattered about their
                necks. Their stained arms and shoulders were bared and intricately marked.
            </p>
            <p>Then Belgarath went down into the valley lying just below the cave, seeking something. It did not take
                his probing mind long to find what he needed. As Garion watched with revulsion, the old man casually
                violated a grave. He dug up a grinning human skull and carefully tapped the dirt out of it. "I'll need
                some deer horns," he told Garion. "Not too large and fairly well-matched." He squatted, fierce-looking
                in his furs and tattoos, and began to scrub at the skull with handfuls of dry sand.
            </p>
            <p>There were weather-bleached horns lying here and there in the tall grass, since the deer of the region
                shed their antlers each winter. Garion gathered a dozen or so and returned to the cave to find his
                grandfather boring a pair of holes in the top of the skull. He critically examined the horns Garion had
                brought him, selected a pair of them and screwed them down into the holes. The grating sound of horn
                against bone set Garion's teeth on edge. "What do you think?" Belgarath asked, holding up the horned
                skull.
            </p>
            <p>"It's grotesque," Garion shuddered.</p>
            <p>"That was the general idea," the old man replied. He attached the skull firmly to the top of a long
                staff, decorated it with several feathers and then rose to his feet. "Let's pack up and leave," he said.
            </p>
            <p>They rode down through the treeless foothills and out into the bending, waist-high grass as the sun swung
                down toward the southwestern horizon to dip briefly behind the peaks of the range they had just crossed.
            </p>
            <p>The smell of the uncured pelts Silk had sewn to their clothing was not very pleasant, and Garion did his
                best not to look at the hideously altered skull surmounting Belgarath's staff as they rode.
            </p>
            <p>"We're being watched," Silk mentioned rather casually after an hour or so of riding.</p>
            <p>"I was sure we would be," Belgarath replied. "Just keep going."</p>
            <p>Their first meeting with the Morindim came just as the sun rose. They had paused on the sloping gravel
                bank of a meandering stream to water their mounts, and a dozen or so fur-clad riders, their dark faces
                tattooed into devil masks, cantered up to the opposite bank and stopped. They did not speak, but looked
                hard at the identifying marks Belgarath had so painstakingly contrived. After a brief, whispered
                consultation, they turned their horses and rode back away from the stream. Several minutes later, one
                came galloping back, carrying a bundle wrapped in a fox skin. He paused, dropped the bundle on the bank
                of the stream, and then rode off again without looking back.
            </p>
            <p>"What was that all about?" Garion asked.</p>
            <p>"The bundle's a gift-of sorts," Belgarath answered. "It's an offering to any devils who might be
                accompanying us. Go pick it up."
            </p>
            <p>"What's in it?"</p>
            <p>"A bit of this, a bit of that. I wouldn't open it, if I were you. You're forgetting that you're not
                supposed to talk."
            </p>
            <p>"There's nobody around," Garion replied, turning his head this way and that, looking for any sign of
                their being watched.
            </p>
            <p>"Don't be too sure of that," the old man replied. "There could be a hundred of them hiding in the grass.
                Go pick up the gift and we'll move along. They're polite enough, but they'll be a lot happier when we
                take our devils out of their territory."
            </p>
            <p>They rode on across the flat, featureless plain with a cloud of flies, drawn by the smell of their
                untanned fur garments, plaguing them. Their next meeting, several days later, was less congenial. They
                had moved into a hilly region where huge, rounded, white boulders rose out of the grass and where
                shaggy-coated wild oxen with great, sweeping horns grazed. A high overcast had moved in, and the gray
                sky diffused the light, making the brief twilight that marked the passage of one day into the next an
                only slightly perceptible darkening. They were riding down a gentle slope toward a large lake, which lay
                like a sheet of lead under the cloudy sky, when there suddenly arose from the tall grass all around them
                tattooed and fur-clad warriors holding long spears and short bows that appeared to be made of bone.
            </p>
            <p>Garion reined in sharply and looked at Belgarath for instruction. "Just look straight at them," his
                grandfather told him quietly, "and remember that you're not permitted to speak."
            </p>
            <p>"More of them coming," Silk said tersely, jerking his chin toward the crest of a nearby hill where
                perhaps a dozen Morindim, mounted on paint-decorated ponies, were approaching at a walk.
            </p>
            <p>"Let me do the talking," Belgarath said.</p>
            <p>"Gladly."</p>
            <p>The man in the lead of the mounted group was burlier than most of his companions, and the black tattooing
                on his face had been outlined with red and blue, marking him as a man of some significance in his clan
                and making the devil mask of his features all the more hideous. He carried a large wooden club, painted
                with strange symbols and inlaid with rows of sharp teeth taken from various animals. The way he carried
                it indicated that it was more a badge of office than a weapon. He rode without a saddle and with a
                single bridle strap. He pulled his pony to a stop perhaps thirty yards away. "Why have you come into the
                lands of the Weasel Clan?" he demanded abruptly. His accent was strange and his eyes were flat with
                hostility.
            </p>
            <p>Belgarath drew himself up indignantly. "Surely the Headman of the Weasel Clan has seen the quest-mark
                before," he replied coldly. "We have no interest in the lands of the Weasel Clan, but follow the
                commands of the Devil-Spirit of the Wolf Clan in the quest he has laid upon us."
            </p>
            <p>"I have not heard of the Wolf Clan," the Headman replied. "Where are their lands?"</p>
            <p>"To the west," Belgarath replied. "We have traveled for two waxings and wanings of the Moon-Spirit to
                reach this place."
            </p>
            <p>The Headman seemed impressed by that.</p>
            <p>A Morind with long white braids and with a thin, dirty-looking beard drew his pony in beside that of the
                Headman. In his right hand he carried a staff surmounted by the skull of a large bird. The gaping beak
                of the skull had been decorated with teeth, giving it a ferocious appearance. "What is the name of the
                Devil-Spirit of the Wolf Clan?" he demanded. "I may know him."
            </p>
            <p>"That is doubtful, Magician of the Weasel Clan," Belgarath answered politely. "He seldom goes far from
                his people. In any case, I cannot speak his name, since he has forbidden it to any but the dreamers."
            </p>
            <p>"Can you say what his aspect is and his attributes?" the whitebraided magician asked.</p>
            <p>Silk made a long-gurgling sound in the back of his throat, stiffened in his saddle and rolled his eyes
                gruesomely back in his head until only the whites showed. With a convulsive, jerking motion, he thrust
                both arms into the air. "Beware the Devil Agrinja, who stalks unseen behind us," he intoned in a hollow,
                oracular voice. "I have seen his three-eyed face and his hundred-fanged mouth in my dreams. The eye of
                mortal man may not behold him, but his seven-clawed hands reach out even now to rend apart all who would
                stand in the path of his chosen quester, the spear-bearer of the Wolf Clan. I have seen him feed in my
                nightmares. The ravener approaches and he hungers for man-meat. Flee his hunger." He shuddered, dropping
                his arms and slumping forward in his saddle as if suddenly exhausted.
            </p>
            <p>"You've been here before, I see," Belgarath muttered under his breath. "Try to restrain your creativity,
                though. Remember that I might have to produce what you dream up."
            </p>
            <p>Silk cast him a sidelong wink. His description of the Devil had made a distinct impression on the
                Morindim. The mounted men looked about nervously, and those standing in the waist-high grass moved
                involuntarily closer together, grasping their weapons in trembling hands.
            </p>
            <p>Then a thin Morind with a white fur band around his left arm pushed through the cluster of frightened
                warriors. His right leg ended in a clubfoot, and he lurched grotesquely as he walked. He fixed Silk with
                a glare of pure hatred, then threw both hands wide, quivering and jerking. His back arched and he
                toppled over, threshing in the grass in the throes of an apparent seizure. He went completely stiff and
                then he started to speak. "The Devil-Spirit of the Weasel Clan, dread Horja, speaks to me. He demands to
                know why the Devil Agrinja sends his quester into the lands of the Weasel Clan. The Devil Horja is too
                awful to look upon. He has four eyes and a hundred and ten teeth, and each of his six hands has eight
                claws. He feeds on the bellies of men and he hungers."
            </p>
            <p>"An imitator," Silk sniffed disdainfully, his head still down. "He can't even think up his own dream."
            </p>
            <p>The magician of the Weasel Clan gave the dreamer lying supine in the grass a look of disgust, then turned
                back to Belgarath. "The Devil-Spirit Horja defies the Devil-Spirit Agrinja," he declared. "He bids him
                to begone or he will rip out the belly of the quester of Agrinja."
            </p>
            <p>Belgarath swore under his breath.</p>
            <p>"What now?" Silk muttered.</p>
            <p>"I have to fight him," Belgarath replied sourly. "That's what this was leading up to from the
                beginning.
            </p>
            <p>Whitebraids there is trying to make a name for himself. He's probably been attacking every magician who
                crosses his path."
            </p>
            <p>"Can you handle him?"</p>
            <p>"We're about to find out." Belgarath slid out of his saddle. "I warn you to stand aside," he boomed,
                "lest I loose the hunger of our Devil Spirit upon you." With the tip of his staff he drew a circle on
                the ground and a five-pointed star within the circle. Grimly, he stepped into the center of the design.
            </p>
            <p>The whitebraided magician of the Weasel Clan sneered and also slid off his pony. Quickly he drew a
                similar symbol on the ground and stepped into its protection.
            </p>
            <p>"That's it," Silk muttered to Garion. "Once the symbols are drawn, neither one can back down."</p>
            <p>Belgarath and the whitebraided magician had each begun muttering incantations in a language Garion had
                never heard, brandishing their skull-surmounted staffs at each other. The dreamer of the Weasel Clan,
                suddenly realizing that he was in the middle of the impending battle, miraculously recovered from his
                seizure, scrambled to his feet, and lurched away with a terrified expression.
            </p>
            <p>The Headman, trying to maintain his dignity, carefully backed his pony out of the immediate vicinity of
                the two muttering old men. Atop a large, white boulder, twenty yards or so to the left of the two
                magicians, there was a shimmering disturbance in the air, somewhat like heatwaves rising from a red tile
                roof on a hot day. The movement caught Garion's eye, and he stared in puzzlement at the strange
                phenomenon. As he watched, the shimmering became more pronounced, and it seemed that the shattered
                pieces of a rainbow infused it, flickering, shifting, undulating in waves almost like varihued flames
                rising from an invisible fire.
            </p>
            <p>As Garion watched, fascinated, a second shimmering became apparent, rising above the tall grass off to
                the right. The second disturbance also began to gather shards of color into itself. As he stared, first
                at one, then at the other, Garion saw - or imagined that he saw - a shape beginning to emerge in the
                center of each. The shapes at first were amorphous, shifting, changing, gathering form from the
                coruscating colors flashing

            </p>
            <p>about them in the shimmering air. Then it seemed that the shapes, having reached a certain point, flashed
                to completion, coalescing quite suddenly with a great rushing together, and two towering forms faced
                each other, snarling and slavering with mindless hatred. Each stood as high as a house, and their
                shoulders bulked wide. Their skins were multihued, with waves of color rippling through them.
            </p>
            <p>The one standing in the grass had a third eye glaring balefully from between its other two, and his great
                arms ended in seven-clawed hands stretched out with a hideously hungry curving. His jutting, muzzlelike
                mouth gaped wide, filled with row upon row of needlelike teeth as he roared a thunderous howl of hatred
                and dreadful hunger.
            </p>
            <p>Crouched upon the boulder stood the other. He had a great cluster of shoulders at the top of his trunk,
                and a nest of long, scaly arms that writhed out in all directions like snakes, each arm terminating in a
                widespread, many-clawed hand. Two sets of eyes, one atop the other, glared insanely from beneath heavy
                brow-ridges, and his muzzle, like that of the other figure, sprouted a forest of teeth. He raised that
                awful face and bellowed, his jaws drooling foam.
            </p>
            <p>But even as the two monsters glared at each other, there seemed to be a kind of writhing struggle going
                on inside them. Their skins rippled, and large moving lumps appeared in odd places on their chests and
                sides.
            </p>
            <p>Garion had the peculiar feeling that there was something else - something quite different and perhaps
                even worse - trapped inside each apparition. Growling, the two devils advanced upon each other, but
                despite their apparent eagerness to fight, they seemed almost driven, whipped toward the struggle. It
                was as if there was a dreadful reluctance in them, and their grotesque faces jerked this way and that,
                each snarling first at his opponent and then at the magician who controlled him. That reluctance, Garion
                perceived, stemmed from something deep inside the nature of each Devil. It was the enslavement, the
                compulsion to do the bidding of another, that they hated. The chains of spell and incantation in which
                Belgarath and the whitebraided Morind had bound them were an intolerable agony, and there were whimpers
                of that agony mingled with their snarls.
            </p>
            <p>Belgarath was sweating. Droplets of perspiration trickled down his dark-stained face. The incantations
                which held the Devil Agrinja locked within the apparition he had created to bind it rippled endlessly
                from his tongue. The slightest faltering of either the words or the image he had formed in his mind
                would break his power over the beast he had summoned, and it would turn upon him.
            </p>
            <p>Writhing like things attempting to tear themselves apart from within, Agrinja and Horja closed on each
                other, grappling, clawing, tearing out chunks of scaly flesh with their awful jaws. The earth shuddered
                beneath them as they fought.
            </p>
            <p>Too stunned to even be afraid, Garion watched the savage struggle. As he watched, he noted a peculiar
                difference between the two apparitions. Agrinja was bleeding from his wounds - a strange, dark blood, so
                deep red as to be almost black. Horja, however, did not bleed. Chunks ripped from his arms and shoulders
                were like bits of wood. The whitebraided magician saw that difference as well, and his eyes grew
                suddenly afraid. His voice became shrill as he desperately cast incantations at Horja, struggling to
                keep the Devil under his control. The moving lumps beneath Horja's skin became larger, more agitated.
                The vast Devil broke free from Agrinja and stood, his chest heaving and a dreadful hope burning in his
                eyes.
            </p>
            <p>Whitebraids was screaming now. The incantations tumbled from his mouth, faltering, stumbling. And then
                one unpronounceable formula tangled his tongue. Desperately he tried it again, and once again it stuck
                in his teeth.
            </p>
            <p>With a bellow of triumph the Devil Horja straightened and seemed to explode. Bits and fragments of scaly
                hide flew in all directions as the monster shuddered free of the illusion which had bound him. He had
                two great arms and an almost human face surmounted by a pair of curving, needle-pointed horns. He had
                hoofs instead of feet, and his grayish skin dripped slime. He turned slowly and his burning eyes fixed
                on the gibbering magician.
            </p>
            <p>"Horja!" the whitebraided Morind shrieked, "I command you to-" The words faltered as he gaped in horror
                at the Devil which had suddenly escaped his control. "Horja! I am your master!" But Horja was already
                stalking toward him, his great hoofs crushing the grass as, step by step, he moved toward his former
                master.
            </p>
            <p>In wild-eyed panic, the whitebraided Morind flinched back, stepping unconsciously and fatally out of the
                protection of the circle and star drawn upon the ground.
            </p>
            <p>Horja smiled then, a chilling smile, bent and caught the shrieking magician by each ankle, ignoring the
                blows rained on his head and shoulders by the skull-topped staff. Then the monster stood up, lifting the
                struggling man to hang upside down by the legs. The huge shoulders surged with an awful power, and,
                leering hideously, the Devil deliberately and with a cruel slowness tore the magician in two.
            </p>
            <p>The Morindim fled.</p>
            <p>Contemptuously the immense Devil hurled the chunks of his former master after them, spattering the grass
                with blood and worse. Then, with a savage hunting cry, he leaped in pursuit of them.
            </p>
            <p>The three-eyed Agrinja had stood, still locked in a half crouch, watching the destruction of the
                whitebraided Morind almost with indifference. When it was aver, he turned to cast eyes burning with
                hatred upon Belgarath.
            </p>
            <p>The old sorcerer, drenched with sweat, raised his skull-staff in front of him, his face set with extreme
                concentration. The interior struggle rippled more intensely within the form of the monster, but
                gradually Belgarath's will mastered and solidified the shape. Agrinja howled in frustration, clawing at
                the air until all hint of shifting or changing was gone. Then the dreadful hands dropped, and the
                monster's head bowed in defeat.
            </p>
            <p>"Begone," Belgarath commanded almost negligently, and Agrinja instantly vanished.</p>
            <p>Garion suddenly began to tremble violently. His stomach heaved; he turned, tottered a few feet away, and
                fell to his knees and began to retch.
            </p>
            <p>"What happened?" Silk demanded in a shaking voice.</p>
            <p>"It got away from him," Belgarath replied calmly. "I think it was the blood that did it. When he saw that
                Agrinja was bleeding and that Horja wasn't, he realized that he'd forgotten something. That shook his
                confidence, and he lost his concentration. Garion, stop that."
            </p>
            <p>"I can't," Garion groaned, his stomach heaving violently again. "How long will Horja chase the others?"
            </p>
            <p>Silk asked.</p>
            <p>"Until the sun goes down," Belgarath told him. "I imagine that the Weasel Clan is in for a bad
                afternoon."
            </p>
            <p>"Is there any chance that he'll turn around and come after us?"</p>
            <p>"He has no reason to. We didn't try to enslave him. As soon as Garion gets his stomach under control
                again, we can go on. We won't be bothered any more."
            </p>
            <p>Garion stumbled to his feet, weakly wiping his mouth. "Are you all right?" Belgarath asked him.</p>
            <p>"Not really," Garion replied, "but there's nothing left to come up."</p>
            <p>"Get a drink of water and try riot to think about it."</p>
            <p>"Will you have to do that any more?" Silk asked, his eyes a bit wild.</p>
            <p>"No." Belgarath pointed. There were several riders along the crest of a hill perhaps a mile away. "The
                other Morindim in the area watched the whole thing. The word will spread, and nobody will come anywhere
                near us now. Let's mount up and get going. It's still a long way to the coast."
            </p>
            <p>In bits and pieces, as they rode for the next several days, Garion picked up as much information as he
                really wanted about the dreadful contest he had witnessed.
            </p>
            <p>"It's the shape that's the key to the whole thing," Belgarath concluded. "What the Morindim call
                Devil-Spirits don't look that much different from humans. You form an illusion drawn out of your
                imagination and force the spirit into it. As long as you can keep it locked up in that illusion, it has
                to do what you tell it to. If the illusion falters for any reason, the spirit breaks free and resumes
                its real form. After that, you have no control over it whatsoever. I have a certain advantage in these
                matters. Changing back and forth from a man to a wolf has sharpened my imagination a bit."
            </p>
            <p>"Why did Beldin say you were a bad magician then?" Silk asked curiously.</p>
            <p>"Beldin's a purist," the old man shrugged. "He feels that it's necessary to get everything into the shape
                -
            </p>
            <p>down to the last scale and toenail. It isn't, really, but he feels that way about it."</p>
            <p>"Do you suppose we could talk about something else?" Garion asked.</p>
            <p>They reached the coastline a day or so later. The sky had remained overcast, and the Sea of the East lay
                sullen and rolling under dirty gray clouds. The beach along which they rode was a broad shingle of
                black, round stones littered with chunks of white, bleached driftwood. Waves rolled foaming up the
                beach, only to slither back with an endless, mournful sigh. Sea birds hung in the stiff breeze,
                screaming.
            </p>
            <p>"Which way?" Silk asked.</p>
            <p>Belgarath looked around. "North," he replied.</p>
            <p>"How far?"</p>
            <p>"I'm not positive. It's been a long time, and I can't be sure exactly where we are."</p>
            <p>"You're not the best guide in the world, old friend," Silk complained.</p>
            <p>"You can't have everything."</p>
            <p>They reached the land bridge two days later, and Garion stared at it in dismay. It was not at all what he
                had expected, but consisted of a series of round, wave-eroded white boulders sticking up out of the dark
                water and running in an irregular line off toward a dark smudge on the horizon. The wind was blowing out
                of the north, carrying with it a bitter chill and the smell of polar ice. Patches of white froth
                stretched from boulder to boulder as the swells ripped themselves to tatters on submerged reefs.
            </p>
            <p>"How are we supposed to cross that?" Silk objected.</p>
            <p>"We wait until low tide," Belgarath explained. "The reefs are mostly out of the water then."</p>
            <p>"Mostly?"</p>
            <p>"We might have to wade a bit from time to time. Let's strip these furs off our clothes before we start.
                It will give us something to do while we're waiting for the tide to turn, and they're starting to get a
                bit fragrant."
            </p>
            <p>They took shelter behind a pile of driftwood far up on the beach and removed the stiff, smelly furs from
                their clothing. Then they dug food out of their packs and ate. Garion noted that the stain that had
                darkened the skin on his hands had begun to wear thin and that the tattoodrawings on the faces of his
                companions had grown noticeably fainter.
            </p>
            <p>It grew darker, and the period of twilight that separated one day from the next seemed longer than it had
                no more than a week ago.
            </p>
            <p>"Summer's nearly over up here," Belgarath noted, looking out at the boulders gradually emerging from the
                receding water in the murky twilight.
            </p>
            <p>"How much longer before low tide?" Silk asked.</p>
            <p>"Another hour or so."</p>
            <p>They waited. The wind pushed at the pile of driftwood erratically and brushed the tall grass along the
                upper edge of the beach, bending and tossing it.
            </p>
            <p>Finally Belgarath stood up. "Let's go," he said shortly. "We'll lead the horses. The reefs are slippery,
                so be careful how you set your feet down."
            </p>
            <p>The passage along the reef between the first steppingstones was not all that bad, but once they moved
                farther out, the wind became a definite factor. They were frequently drenched with stinging spray, and
                every so often a wave, larger than the others, broke over the top of the reef and swirled about their
                legs, tugging at them. The water was brutally cold.
            </p>
            <p>"Do you think we'll be able to make it all the way across before the tide comes back in again?" Silk
                shouted over the noise.
            </p>
            <p>"No," Belgarath shouted back. "We'll have to sit it out on top of one of the larger rocks."</p>
            <p>"That sounds unpleasant."</p>
            <p>"Not nearly so unpleasant as swimming."</p>
            <p>They were perhaps halfway across when it became evident that the tide turned. Waves more and more
                frequently broke across the top of the reef, and one particularly large pulled the legs of Garion's
                horse out from under him. Garion struggled to get the frightened animal up again, pulling at the reins
                as the horse's hoofs scrambled and slid on the slippery rocks of the reef. "We'd better find a place to
                stop, Grandfather,"
            </p>
            <p>he yelled above the crash of the waves. "We'll be neck-deep in this before long."</p>
            <p>"Two more islands," Belgarath told . "'here's a bigger one up ahead."</p>
            <p>The last stretch of reef was completely submerged, and Garion flinched as he stepped down into the icy
                water, The breaking waves covered the surface with froth, making it impossible to see the bottom. He
                moved along blindly, probing the unseen path with numb feet. A large wave swelled and rose up as far as his armpits, and its powerful surge swept him of his feet. He clung to the reins of his horse,
                floundering and sputtering as he fought to get back up.
            </p>
            <p>And then they were past the worst of it. They moved along the reef with the water only ankle-deep now; a
                few moments later, they climbed up onto the large, white boulder. Garion let out a long, explosive
                breath as he reached safety. The wind, blowing against his wet clothing, chilled him to the bone but at
                least they were out of the water.
            </p>
            <p>Later, as they sat huddled together on the leeward side of the boulder, Garion looked out across the
                sullen black sea toward the low, forbidding coastline lying ahead. The beaches, like those of Morindland
                behind them, were black gravel, and the low hills behind them were dark under the scudding gray cloud.
                Nowhere was there any sign of life, but there was an implicit threat in the very shape of the land
                itself.
            </p>
            <p>"Is that it?" he asked finally in a hushed voice.</p>
            <p>Belgarath's face was unreadable as he gazed across the open water toward the coast ahead. "Yes," he
                replied. "That's Mallorea."

        <chapter number="8">
            <p>THE CROWN HAD been Queen Islena's first mistake. It was heavy and it always gave her a headache. Her
                decision to wear it had come originally out of a sense of insecurity. The bearded warnors in Anheg's
                throne room intimidated her, and she felt the need of a visible symbol of her authority. Now she was
                afraid to appear without it. Each day she put it on with less pleasure and entered the main hall of
                Anheg's palace with less certainty.
            </p>
            <p>The sad truth was that Queen Islena of Cherek was completely unprepared to rule. Until the day when,
                dressed in regal crimson velvet and with her gold crown firmly in place, she had marched into the
                vaulted throne room at Val Alorn to announce that she would rule the kingdom in her husband's absence,
                Islena's most momentous decisions had involved which gown she would wear and how her hair was to be
                arranged.
            </p>
            <p>Now it seemed that the fate of Cherek hung in the balance each time she was faced with a choice.</p>
            <p>The warriors lounging indolently with their ale cups about the huge, open fire pit or wandering aimlessly
                about on the rush-strewn floor were no help whatsoever. Each time she entered the throne room, all
                conversation broke off and they rose to watch as she marched to the bannerhung throne, but their faces
                gave no hint of their true feelings toward her. Irrationally, she concluded that the whole problem had
                to do with the beards. How could she possibly know what a man was thinking when his face was sunk up to
                the ears in hair? Only the quick intervention of Lady Merel, the cool blond wife of the Earl of
                Trellheim, had stopped her from ordering a universal shave.
            </p>
            <p>"You can't, Islena," Merel had told her flatly, removing the quill from the queen's hand, even as she had
                been in the act of signing the hastily drawn-up proclamation. "They're attached to their beards like
                little boys attached to a favorite toy. You can't make them cut off their whiskers."
            </p>
            <p>"I'm the Queen."</p>
            <p>"Only as long as they permit you to be. They accept you out of respect for Anheg, and that's as far as it
                goes. If you tamper with their pride, they'll take you off the throne." And that dreadful threat had
                ended the matter then and there.
            </p>
            <p>Islena found herself relying more and more on Barak's wife, and it was not long before the two of them,
                one in green and the other in royal crimson, were seldom apart. Even when Islena faltered, Merel's icy
                stare quelled the hints of disrespect which cropped up from time to time - usually when the ale had been
                distributed a bit too freely. It was Merel, ultimately, who made the day-to-day decisions which ran the
                kingdom. When IsIena sat upon the throne, Merel, her blond braids coiled about her head to form her own
                crown, stood to one side in plain view of the hesitant queen. Cherek was ruled by the expressions on her
                face. A faint smile meant yes; a frown, no; a scarcely perceptible shrug, maybe. It worked out fairly
                well.
            </p>
            <p>But there was one person who was not intimidated by Merel's cool gaze. Grodeg, the towering,
                white-bearded High Priest of Belar, inevitably requested private audience with the queen, and once Merel
                left the council room, Islena was lost.
            </p>
            <p>Despite Anheg's call for a general mobilization, the members of the Bear-cult had not yet left to join
                the campaign. Their promises to join the fleet later all sounded sincere, but their excuses and delays
                grew more and more obvious as time went on. Islena knew that Grodeg was behind it all. Nearly every
                able-bodied man in the kingdom was off with the fleet, which was even now rowing up the broad expanse of
                the Aldur River to join Anheg in central Algaria. The household guard in the palace at Val Alorn had
                been reduced to

            </p>
            <p>grizzled old men and downy-cheeked boys. Only the Bear-cult remained, and Grodeg pushed his advantage to
                the limit.
            </p>
            <p>He was polite enough, bowing to the queen when the occasion demanded, and never mentioning her past links
                with the cult, but his offers to help became more and more insistent; and when Islena faltered at his
                suggestions concerning this matter or that, he smoothly acted to implement them as if her hesitancy had
                been acceptance. Little by little, Islena was losing control, and Grodeg, with the armed might of the
                cult behind him, was taking charge. More and more the cult members infested the palace, giving orders,
                lounging about the throne room and openly grinning as they watched Islena's attempts to rule.
            </p>
            <p>"You're going to have to do something, Islena," Merel said firmly one evening when the two were alone in
                the queen's private apartment. She was striding about the carpeted room, her hair gleaming like soft
                gold in the candlelight, but there was nothing soft in her expression.
            </p>
            <p>"What can I do?" Islena pleaded, wringing her hands. "He's never openly disrespectful, and his decisions
                always seem to be in the best interests of Cherek."
            </p>
            <p>"You need help, Islena," Merel told her.</p>
            <p>"Whom can I turn to?" The Queen of Cherek was almost in tears. The Lady Merel smoothed the front of her
                green velvet gown.
            </p>
            <p>"I think it's time that you wrote to Porenn," she declared.</p>
            <p>"What do I say?" Islena begged of her.</p>
            <p>Merel pointed at the small table in the corner where parchment and ink lay waiting. "Sit down," she
                instructed, "and write what I tell you to write."
            </p>
            <p>Count Brador, the Tolnedran ambassador, was definitely growing tiresome, Queen Layla decided. The plump
                little queen marched purposefully toward the chamber where she customarily gave audiences and where the
                ambassador awaited her with his satchel full of documents.
            </p>
            <p>The courtiers in the halls bowed as she passed, her crown slightly askew and her heels clicking on the
                polished oak floors, but Queen Layla uncharacteristically ignored them. This was not the time for polite
                exchanges or idle chitchat. The Tolnedran had to be dealt with, and she had delayed too long already.
            </p>
            <p>The ambassador was an olive-skinned man with receding hair and a hooked nose. He wore a brown mantle with
                the old trim that indicated his relationship to the Borunes. He lounged rather indolently in a large
                cushioned chair near the window of the sunny room where he and Queen Layla were to meet. He rose as she
                entered and bowed with exquisite grace. "Your Highness," he murmured politely.
            </p>
            <p>"My dear Count Brador," Queen Layla gushed at him, putting on her most helpless and scatterbrained
                expression, "please do sit down. I'm sure we know each other well enough by now to skip all these
                tedious formalities." She sank into a chair, fanning herself with one hand. "It's turned warm, hasn't
                it?"
            </p>
            <p>"Summers are lovely here in Sendaria, your Highness," the count replied, settling back in his chair. "I
                wonder - have you had the chance to think over the proposals I gave you at our last meeting?"
            </p>
            <p>Queen Layla stared at him blankly. "Which proposals were those, Count Brador?" She gave a helpless little
                giggle. "Please forgive me, but my mind seems to be absolutely gone these days. There are so many
                details.
            </p>
            <p>I wonder how my husband keeps them all straight."</p>
            <p>"We were discussing the administration of the port at Camaar, your Highness," the count reminded her
                gently.
            </p>
            <p>"We were?" The queen gave him a blank look of total incomprehension, secretly delighted at the flicker of
                annoyance that crossed his face. It was her best ploy. By pretending to have forgotten all previous
                conversations, she forced him to begin at the beginning every time they met. The count's strategy, she
                knew, depended upon a gradual build-up to his final proposal, and her pretended forgetfulness neatly
                defeated that. "Whatever led us into such a tedious subject as that?" she added.
            </p>
            <p>"Surely your Highness recalls," the count protested with just the slightest hint of annoyance. "The
                Tolnedran merchant vessel, Star of Tol Horb, was kept standing at anchor for a week and a half in the
                harbor before moorage could be found for her. Every day's delay in unloading her was costing a fortune."
            </p>
            <p>"Things are so hectic these days," the queen of Sendaria sighed. "It's the manpower shortage, you
                understand. Everybody who hasn't gone off to war is busy freighting supplies to the army. I'll send a
                very stern note to the port authorities about it, though. Was there anything else, Count Brador?"
            </p>
            <p>Brador coughed uncomfortably. "Uh - your Highness has already forwarded just such a note," he reminded
                her.
            </p>
            <p>"I have?" Queen Layla feigned astonishment. "Wonderful. That takes care of everything then, doesn't it?
            </p>
            <p>And you've dropped by to thank me." She smiled girlishly. "How exquisitely courteous of you." She leaned
                forward to put one hand impulsively on his wrist, quite deliberately knocking the rolled parchment he
                was holding out of his hand. "How clumsy of me," she exclaimed, bending quickly to pick up the parchment
                before he could retrieve it. Then she sat back in her chair, tapping the rolled document absently
                against her cheek as if lost in thought.
            </p>
            <p>"Uh - actually, your Highness, our discussions had moved somewhat beyond your note to the port
                authorities," Brador told her, nervously eyeing the parchment she had so deftly taken from him. "You may
                recall that I offered Tolnedran assistance in administering the port. I believe we agreed that such
                assistance might help to alleviate the manpower shortage your Highness just mentioned."
            </p>
            <p>"What an absolutely marvelous idea," Layla exclaimed. She brought her plump little fist down on the arm
                of her chair as if in an outburst of enthusiasm. At that prearranged signal, two of her younger children
                burst into the room, arguing loudly.
            </p>
            <p>"Mother!" Princess Gelda wailed in outrage, "Fernie stole my red ribbon!"</p>
            <p>"I did not!" Princess Ferna denied the charge indignantly. "She gave it to me for my blue beads."</p>
            <p>"Did not!" Gelda snapped.</p>
            <p>"Did so!" Ferna replied.</p>
            <p>"Children, children," Layla chided them. "Can't you see that Mother's busy? What will the dear count
                think of us?"
            </p>
            <p>"But she stole it, Mother!" Gelda protested. "She stole my red ribbon."</p>
            <p>"Did not!" Ferna said, spitefully sticking her tongue out at her sister.</p>
            <p>Trailing behind them with a look of wide-eyed interest came little Prince Meldig, Queen Layla's youngest
                child. In one hand the prince held a jam pot, and his face was liberally smeared with the contents.
            </p>
            <p>"Oh, that's just impossible," Layla exclaimed, jumping to her feet. "You girls are supposed to be
                watching him." She bustled over to the jam-decorated prince, crumpled the parchment she was holding and
                began wiping his face with it. Abruptly she stopped. "Oh dear," she said as if suddenly realizing what
                she was doing. "Was this important, Count Brador?" she asked the Tolnedran, holding out the rumpled,
                sticky document.
            </p>
            <p>Brador's shoulders, however, had slumped in defeat. "No, your Highness," he replied in a voice filled
                with resignation, "not really. The royal house of Sendaria has me quite outnumbered, it appears." He
                rose to his feet. "Perhaps another time," he murmured, bowing. "With your Highness's permission," he
                said, preparing to leave.
            </p>
            <p>"You mustn't forget this, Count Brador," Layla said, pressing the parchment into his cringing hands.</p>
            <p>The count's face had a faintly martyred expression as he withdrew. Queen Layla turned back to her
                children, who were grinning impishly at her. She began to scold them in a loud voice until she was
                certain the count was well out of earshot, then she knelt, embraced them all and began to laugh.
            </p>
            <p>"Did we do it right, Mother?" Princess Gelda asked.</p>
            <p>"You were absolutely perfect," Queen Layla replied, still laughing.</p>
            <p>Sadi the eunuch had grown careless, lulled somewhat by the air of polite civility that had pervaded the
                palace at Sthiss Tor for the past year, and one of his associates, seizing upon his unwariness, had
                taken the opportunity to poison him. Sadi definitely did not appreciate being poisoned. The antidotes
                all tasted vile, and the aftereffects left him weak and light-headed. Thus it was that he viewed the
                appearance of the mail-skirted emissary of King Taur Urgas with thinly veiled irritation.
            </p>
            <p>"Taur Urgas, King of the Murgos, greets Sadi, chief servant of Immortal Salmissra," the Murgo declaimed
                with a deep bow as he entered the cool, dimly lighted study from which Sadi conducted most of the
                nation's affairs.
            </p>
            <p>"The servant of the Serpent Queen returns the greetings of the right arm of the Dragon-God of Angarak."
            </p>
            <p>Sadi mouthed the formula phrases almost indifferently. "Do you suppose we could get to the point? I'm
                feeling a bit indisposed at the moment."
            </p>
            <p>"I was very pleased at your recovery," the ambassador lied, his scarred face carefully expressionless.
                "Has the poisoner been apprehended yet?" He drew up a chair and sat down at the polished table Sadi used
                for a desk.
            </p>
            <p>"Naturally," Sadi replied,absently rubbing his hand over his shaved scalp.</p>
            <p>"And executed?"</p>
            <p>"Why would we want to do that? The man's a professional poisoner. He was only doing his job."</p>
            <p>The Murgo looked a bit startled.</p>
            <p>"We look upon a good poisoner as a national asset," Sadi told him. "If we start killing them every time
                they poison somebody, very soon there won't be any of them left, and you never know when I might want
                somebody poisoned."
            </p>
            <p>The Murgo ambassador shook his head incredulously. "You people have an amazing amount of tolerance,
                Sadi," he said in his harshly accented voice. "What about his employer?"
            </p>
            <p>"That's another matter," Sadi replied. "His employer is currently entertaining the leeches at the bottom
                of the river. Is your visit official, or did you merely stop by to inquire after my health?"
            </p>
            <p>"A bit of each, Excellency."</p>
            <p>"You Murgos are an economical race," Sadi observed dryly. "What does Taur Urgas want this time?"</p>
            <p>"The Alorns are preparing to invade Mishrak ac Thull, your Excellency."</p>
            <p>"So I've heard. What's that got to do with Nyissa?"</p>
            <p>"Nyissans have no reason to be fond of Alorns."</p>
            <p>"Nor any to be fond of Murgos, either," Sadi pointed out.</p>
            <p>"It was Aloria that invaded Nyissa following the death of the Rivan King," the Murgo reminded him, "and
                it was Cthol Murgos that provided the market for Nyissa's primary export."
            </p>
            <p>"My dear fellow, please get to the point," Sadi said, rubbing his scalp wearily. "I'm not going to
                operate on the basis of long-past insults or long-forgotten favors. The slave trade is no longer
                significant, and the scars left by the Alorn invasion disappeared centuries ago. What does Taur Urgas
                want?"
            </p>
            <p>"My king wishes to avoid bloodshed," the Murgo stated. "The Tolnedran legions form a significant part of
                the armies massing in Algaria. If a threat just a threat, mind you - of unfriendly activity suddenly
                appeared on his unprotected southern frontier, Ran Borune would recall those legions. Their loss would
                persuade the Alorns to abandon this adventure."
            </p>
            <p>"You want me to invade Tolnedra?" Sadi demanded incredulously.</p>
            <p>"Naturally not, Lord Sadi. His Majesty merely wishes your permission to move certain forces through your
                territory to pose the threat on Tolnedra's southern border. No blood need be shed at all."
            </p>
            <p>"Except Nyissan blood, once the Murgo army withdraws. The legions would swarm down across the River of
                the Woods like angry hornets."
            </p>
            <p>"Taur Urgas would be more than willing to leave garrisons behind to guarantee the integrity of Nyissan
                territory."
            </p>
            <p>"I'm sure he would," Sadi observed dryly. "Advise your king that his proposal is quite unacceptable at
                this particular time."
            </p>
            <p>"The King of Cthol Murgos is a powerful man," the Murgo said firmly, "and he remembers those who thwart
                him even more keenly than he remembers his friends."
            </p>
            <p>"Taur Urgas is a madman," Sadi told him bluntly. "He wants to avoid trouble with the Alorns so that he
                can concentrate on 'Zakath. Despite his insanity, however, he's not so foolish as to send an army into
                Nyissa uninvited. An army must eat, and Nyissa's a bad place to forage for food - as history has
                demonstrated. The most tempting fruit has bitter juice."
            </p>
            <p>"A Murgo army carries its own food," the ambassador replied stiffly.</p>
            <p>"Good for them. But where do they plan to find drinking water? I don't believe we're getting anywhere
                with this. I'll convey your proposal to her Majesty. She, of course, will make the final decision. I
                suspect, however, that you'll need to offer something much more attractive than a permanent Murgo
                occupation to persuade her to consider the matter favorably. Was that all?"
            </p>
            <p>The Murgo rose to his feet, his scarred face angry. He bowed coldly to Sadi and withdrew without further
                conversation.
            </p>
            <p>Sadi thought about it for a while. He could gain a great deal of advantage at a minimal cost if he played
                this right. A few carefully worded dispatches to King Rhodar in Algaria would put Nyissa among the
                friends of the west. If Rhodar's army should happen to win, Nyissa would benefit. If, on the other hand,
                it appeared that the west was about to lose, the proposal of Taur Urgas could be accepted. In either
                case, Nyissa would be on the winning side. The whole notion appealed to Sadi enormously. He stood up,
                his iridescent silk robe rustling, and went to a nearby cabinet. He took out a crystal decanter
                containing a dark blue liquid and carefully measured some of the thick syrup into a small glass and
                drank it. Almost immediately a euphoric calm came over him as his favorite drug took effect. A moment or
                two later, he felt that he was ready to face his queen. He was even smiling as he walked from his study
                into the dim corridor leading to the throne room.
            </p>
            <p>As always, Salmissra's chamber was dimly lighted by oil lamps hanging on long silver chains from the
                shadowy ceiling. The chorus of eunuchs still knelt adoringly in the queen's presence, but they no longer
                sang her praises. Noise of any kind irritated Salmissra now, and it was wise not to irritate her. The
                Serpent Queen still occupied the divanlike throne beneath the towering statue of Issa. She dozed
                interminably, stirring her mottled coils with the seething dry hiss of scale rubbing against scale. But
                even in restless doze, her tongue flickered nervously. Sadi approached the throne, perfunctorily
                prostrated himself on the polished stone floor, and waited. His scent on the air would announce him to
                the hooded serpent who was his queen.
            </p>
            <p>"Yes, Sadi?" she whispered finally, her voice a dusty hiss.</p>
            <p>"The Murgos wish an alliance, my Queen," Sadi informed her. "Taur Urgas wants to threaten the Tolnedrans
                from the south to force Ran Borune to withdraw his legions from the Thullish border."
            </p>
            <p>"Interesting," she replied indifferently. Her dead eyes bored into him and her coils rustled. "What do
                you think?"
            </p>
            <p>"Neutrality costs nothing, Divine Salmissra," Sadi replied. "Alliance with either side would be
                premature."
            </p>
            <p>Salmissra turned, her mottled hood flaring as she regarded her reflection in the mirror beside her
                throne.
            </p>
            <p>The crown still rested on her head as polished and glistening as her scales. Her tongue flickered, and
                her eyes, flat as glass, looked at the mirror. "Do what you think best, Sadi,'' she told him in an
                uncaring tone.
            </p>
            <p>"I'll deal with the matter, my Queen," Sadi said, putting his face to the floor in preparation to
                leave.
            </p>
            <p>"I have no need of Torak now," she mused, still staring at the mirror. "Polgara saw to that."</p>
            <p>"Yes, my Queen," Sadi agreed in a neutral voice, beginning to rise.</p>
            <p>She turned to look at him. "Stay a while, Sadi. I'm lonely."</p>
            <p>Sadi sank immediately back to the polished floor.</p>
            <p>"I have such strange dreams sometimes, Sadi," she hissed. "Such very strange dreams. I seem to remember
                things - things that happened when my blood was warm and I was a woman. Strange thoughts come to me in
                my dreams, and strange hungers." She looked directly at him, her hood flaring again as her pointed face
                stretched out toward him. "Was I really like that, Sadi? It all seems like something seen through
                smoke."
            </p>
            <p>"It was a difficult time, my Queen," Sadi replied candidly. "For all of us."</p>
            <p>"Polgara was right, you know," she continued in that expiring whisper. "The potions enflamed me. I think
                it's better this way - no passions, no hungers, no fears." She turned back to her mirror. "You may go
                now, Sadi."
            </p>
            <p>He rose and started toward the door.</p>
            <p>"Oh, Sadi."</p>
            <p>"Yes, my Queen?"</p>
            <p>"If I caused you trouble before, I'm sorry."</p>
            <p>He stared at her.</p>
            <p>"Not very much, of course - but just a little." Then she returned to her reflection.</p>
            <p>Sadi was trembling as he closed the door behind him. Sometime later, he sent for Issus. The shabby,
                one-eyed hireling entered the chief eunuch's study with a certain hesitancy, and his face was a bit
                apprehensive.
            </p>
            <p>"Come in, Issus," Sadi told him calmly.</p>
            <p>"I hope you aren't holding any grudges, Sadi," Issus said nervously, looking about to be sure they were
                alone. "There was nothing personal in it, you know."
            </p>
            <p>"It's all right, Issus," Sadi assured him. "You were only doing what you were paid to do."</p>
            <p>"How did you manage to detect it?" Issus asked with a certain professional curiosity. "Most men are too
                far gone for the antidote to work before they realize they've been poisoned."
            </p>
            <p>"Your concoction leaves just the faintest aftertaste of lemon," Sadi replied. "I've been trained to
                recognize it."
            </p>
            <p>"Ah," Issus said. "I'll have to work on that. Otherwise it's a very good poison."</p>
            <p>"An excellent poison, Issus," Sadi agreed. "That brings us to the reason I sent for you. There's a man I
                think I can dispense with."
            </p>
            <p>Issus' single eye brightened, and he rubbed his hands together. "The usual fee?"</p>
            <p>"Naturally."</p>
            <p>"Who is he?"</p>
            <p>"The Murgo ambassador."</p>
            <p>Issus' face clouded for a moment. "He'll be difficult to get to." He scratched at his stubbled scalp.</p>
            <p>"You'll find a way. I have the utmost confidence in you."</p>
            <p>"I'm the best," Issus agreed with no trace of false modesty.</p>
            <p>"The ambassador's pressing me in certain negotiations that I need to delay," Sadi continued. "His sudden
                demise should interrupt things a bit."
            </p>
            <p>"You don't really have to explain, Sadi," Issus told him. "I don't need to know why you want him
                killed."
            </p>
            <p>"But you do need to know how. For various reasons, I'd like for this to look very natural. Could you
                arrange for him-and perhaps a few others in his household-to come down with some kind of fever?
            </p>
            <p>Something suitably virulent?"</p>
            <p>Issus frowned. "That's tricky. Something like that can get out of hand. You might end up infecting an
                entire neighborhood, and there would be very few survivors."
            </p>
            <p>Sadi shrugged. "One sometimes must make sacrifices. Can you do it?"</p>
            <p>Issus nodded gravely.</p>
            <p>"Do it then, and I'll compose a letter expressing my regrets to King Taur Urgas."</p>
            <p>Queen Silar sat at her loom in the great hall of the Algar Stronghold, humming softly to herself as her
                fingers passed the shuttle back and forth with a drowsy, clicking sound. Sunlight streamed down from the
                narrow windows set high up in the wall, filling the huge, narrow room with a diffused golden light. King
                Cho-Hag and Hettar were away from the Stronghold, preparing a huge encampment some few leagues out from
                the base of the eastern escarpment for the army of Alorns, Arends, Sendars, and Tolnedrans approaching
                from the west. Although he was still within the borders of the kingdom, Cho-Hag had formally transferred
                authority to his wife, extracting a pledge of support from all of the assembled Clan-Chiefs.
            </p>
            <p>The Queen of Algaria was a silent woman, and her calm face seldom betrayed her emotions. She had spent
                her entire life in the background, often so unobtrusively that people did not even realize that she was
                present. She had, however, kept her eyes and her ears open. Her crippled husband, moreover, had confided
                in her. His quiet, dark-haired queen knew exactly what was going on.
            </p>
            <p>Elvar, Archpriest of Algaria, stood, white-robed and much puffed-up with his own importance, reading to
                her the set of carefully prepared proclamations which would effectively transfer all power to him. His
                tone was condescending as he explained them to her.
            </p>
            <p>"Is that all?" she asked when he had finished.</p>
            <p>"It's really for the best, your Highness," he told her loftily. "All the world knows that women are
                unsuited to rule. Shall I send for pen and ink?"
            </p>
            <p>"Not just yet, Elvar," she replied calmly, her hands busy at her loom.</p>
            <p>"But "</p>
            <p>"You know, I just had the oddest thought," she said, looking directly at him. "You're the Archpriest of
                Belar here in Algaria, but you never go out of the Stronghold. Isn't that a bit peculiar?"
            </p>
            <p>"My duties, your Highness, compell me-"</p>
            <p>"Isn't your first duty to the people - and to the children of Belar? We've been terribly selfish keeping
                you here when your heart must be yearning to be out among the clans, overseeing the religious
                instruction of the children."
            </p>
            <p>He stared at her, his mouth suddenly agape.</p>
            <p>"And all the other priests as well," she continued. "They all seem to be concentrated here at the
                Stronghold, pressed into administrative duties. A priest is too valuable a man for such tasks. This
                situation must be corrected immediately."
            </p>
            <p>"But "</p>
            <p>"No, Elvar. My duty as queen is absolutely clear. The children of Algaria must come first. I release you
                from all your duties here at the Stronghold so that you may return to your chosen vocation." She smiled
                suddenly. "I'll even draw up an itinerary for you myself," she said brightly. She thought a moment. "The
                times are troubled," she added, "so perhaps I'd better provide you with an escort - several trustworthy
                men from my own clan who can be depended upon to make sure that you aren't interrupted in your travels
                or distracted from your preaching by any disturbing messages from abroad." She looked at him again.
                "That will be all, Elvar. You'd probably better go pack. It will be a number of seasons before you
                return, I imagine."
            </p>
            <p>The Archpriest of Belar was making strangled noises.</p>
            <p>"Oh, one other thing." The queen carefully chose another skein of yarn and held it up to the sunlight.
                "It's been years since anyone made a survey of the herds. As long as you're going to be out there
                anyway, I think I'd like an accurate count of all the calves and colts in Algaria. It will give you
                something to occupy your mind. Send me a report from time to time, won't you?" She returned to her
                weaving. "You're dismissed, Elvar," she said placidly, not even bothering to look up as the Archpriest,
                shaking with rage, tottered away to make preparations for his roving imprisonment.
            </p>
            <p>Lord Morin, High Chamberlain to his Imperial Majesty, Ran Borune XXIII, sighed as he entered the
                Emperor's private garden. Another tirade was undoubtedly in the offing, and Morin had already heard it
                all a dozen times at least. The Emperor had an extraordinary capacity for repeating himself sometimes.
            </p>
            <p>Ran Borune, however, was in an odd mood. The bald, beak-nosed little Emperor sat pensively in his chair
                beneath a shady arbor, listening to the trilling of his canary. "He's never spoken again, did you know
                that, Morin?" the Emperor said as his chamberlain approached across the close-clipped grass. "Just that
                one time when Polgara was here." He looked at the little golden bird again, his eyes sad. Then he
                sighed. "I think I came out second best in that bargain. Polgara gave me a canary and took Ce'Nedra in
                exchange." He looked around at his sundrenched garden and the cool marble walls surrounding it. "Is it
                just my imagination, Morin, or does the palace seem sort of cold and empty now?" He lapsed once more
                into moody silence, staring with unseeing eyes at a bed of crimson roses.
            </p>
            <p>Then there was an odd sound, and Lord Morin looked sharply at the Emperor, half afraid that his ruler was
                about to go into another seizure. But there was no evidence of that. Instead, Morin perceived that Ran
                Borune was chuckling. "Did you see how she tricked me, Morin?" The Emperor laughed. "She deliberately
                goaded me into that fit. What a son she would have made! She could have been the greatest Emperor in
                Tolnedra's history." Ran Borune was laughing openly now, his secret delight at Ce'Nedra's cleverness
                suddenly emerging.
            </p>
            <p>"She is your daughter after all, your Majesty," Lord Morin observed.</p>
            <p>"To think that she could raise an army of that size when she's barely sixteen," the Emperor marveled.</p>
            <p>"What a splendid child!" He seemed quite suddenly to have recovered from the gloomy peevishness that had
                dogged him since his return to ToI Honeth. His laughter trailed away after several moments, and his
                bright little eyes narrowed shrewdly. "Those legions she stole from me are likely to become fractious
                without professional leadership," he mused.
            </p>
            <p>"I'd say that's Ce'Nedra's problem, your Majesty," Morin replied. "Or Polgara's."</p>
            <p>"Well-" The Emperor scratched one ear. "I don't know, Morin. The situation out there isn't too clear." He
                looked at his chamberlain. "Are you acquainted with General Varana?"
            </p>
            <p>"The Duke of Anadile? Of course, your Majesty. A thoroughly professional sort of fellow - solid,
                unassuming, extremely intelligent."
            </p>
            <p>"He's an old friend of the family," Ran Borune confided. "Ce'Nedra knows him and she would listen to his
                advice. Why don't you go to him, Morin, and suggest that he might want to take a leave of absence -
            </p>
            <p>perhaps go to Algaria and have a look at things?"</p>
            <p>"I'm certain that he'd be overjoyed at the idea of a vacation," Lord Morin agreed. "Garrison life in the
                summertime can be very tedious."
            </p>
            <p>"It's just a suggestion," the Emperor stressed. "His presence in the war zone would have to be strictly
                unofficial."
            </p>
            <p>"Naturally, your Majesty."</p>
            <p>"And if he just happened to make a few suggestions - or even provide a bit of leadership, we certainly
                wouldn't have any knowledge of it, would we? After all, what a private citizen does with his own time is
                his business, right?"
            </p>
            <p>"Absolutely, your Majesty."</p>
            <p>The Emperor grinned broadly. "And we'll all stick to that story, won't we, Morin?"</p>
            <p>"Like glue, your Majesty," Morin replied gravely..</p>
            <p>The crown prince of Drasnia burped noisily in his mother's ear, sighed, and promptly fell asleep on her
                shoulder. Queen Porenn smiled at him, tucked him back in his cradle, and turned again to the
                stringy-appearing man in nondescript clothing who sprawled in a nearby chair. The emaciated man was
                known only by the peculiar name "Javelin." Javelin was the chief of the Drasnian intelligence service
                and one of Porenn's closest advisers.
            </p>
            <p>"Anyway," he continued his report, "the Tolnedran girl's army is about two days' march from the
                Stronghold. The engineers are moving along ahead of schedule with the hoists on top of the escarpment,
                and the Chereks are preparing to begin the portage from the east bank of the Aldur."
            </p>
            <p>"Everything seems to be going according to plan, then," the queen said, resuming her seat at the polished
                table near the window.
            </p>
            <p>"There's a bit of trouble in Arendia," Javelin noted. "The usual ambushes and bickerings - nothing really
                serious. Queen Layla's got the Tolnedran, Bravor, so completely off balance that he might as well not
                even be in Sendaria." He scratched at his long, pointed jaw. "There's peculiar information coming out of
                Sthiss Tor. The Murgos are trying to negotiate something, but their emissaries keep dying. We'll try to
                get

            </p>
            <p>somebody closer to Sadi to find out exactly what's going on. Let's see - what else? Oh, the Honeths have
                finally united behind one candidate-a pompous, arrogant jackass who's offended just about everybody in
                Tol Honeth. They'll try to buy the crown for him, but he'd be hopelessly incompetent as emperor. Even
                with all their money, it's going to be difficult for them to put him on the throne. I guess that's about
                all, your Highness."
            </p>
            <p>"I've had a letter from Islena in Val Alorn," Queen Porenn told him.</p>
            <p>"Yes, your Highness," Javelin replied urbanely, "I know."</p>
            <p>"Javelin, have you been reading my mail again?" she demanded with a sudden flash of irritation.</p>
            <p>"Just trying to stay current with what's going on in the world, Porenn."</p>
            <p>"I've told you to stop that."</p>
            <p>"You didn't really expect me to do it, did you?" He seemed actually surprised.</p>
            <p>She laughed. "You're impossible."</p>
            <p>"Of course I am. I'm supposed to be."</p>
            <p>"Can we get any help to Islena?"</p>
            <p>"I'll put some people on it," he assured her. "We can probably work through Merel, the wife of the Earl
                of Trellheim. She's starting to show some signs of maturity and she's close to Islena."
            </p>
            <p>"I think we'd better have a close look at our own intelligence service, too," Porenn suggested. "Let's
                pin down everyone who might have any connections with the Bear-cult. The time might come when we'll have
                to take steps."
            </p>
            <p>Javelin nodded his agreement.</p>
            <p>There was a light tapping at the door.</p>
            <p>"Yes?" Porenn answered.</p>
            <p>The door opened and a servant thrust his head into the room. "Excuse me, your Highness," he said, "but
                there's a Nadrak merchant here - a man named Yarblek. He says he wants to discuss the salmon run." The
                servant looked perplexed.
            </p>
            <p>Queen Porenn straightened in her chair. "Send him in," she ordered, "at once."</p>

        <chapter number="9">
            <p>THE SPEECHES WERE over. The orations that had caused Princess Ce'Nedra such agony had done their work,
                and she found herself less and less in the center of things. At first the days opened before her full of
            </p>
            <p>glorious freedom. The dreadful anxiety that had filled her at the prospect of addressing vast crowds of
                men two or three times a day was gone now. Her nervous exhaustion disappeared, and she no longer awoke
                in the middle of the night trembling and terrified. For almost an entire week she reveled in it,
                luxuriated in it.
            </p>
            <p>Then, of course, she became dreadfully bored.</p>
            <p>The army she had gathered in Arendia and northern Tolnedra moved like a great sea in the foothills of
                Ulgoland. The Mimbrate knights, their armor glittering in the bright sunlight and their long, streaming,
                many-colored pennons snapping in the breeze, moved at the forefront of the host, and behind them,
                spreading out across the rolling green hills, marched the solid mass of Ce'Nedra's infantry, Sendars,
                Asturians, Rivans, and a few Chereks. And there, solidly in the center, forming the very core, marched
                the gleaming ranks of the legions of Imperial Tolnedra, their crimson standards aloft and the white
                plumes on their helmets waving in time to their measured steps. It was very stirring for the first few
                days to ride at the head of the enormous force, moving at her command toward the east, but the novelty
                of it all soon wore thin.
            </p>
            <p>Princess Ce'Nedra's gradual drift away from the center of command was largely her own fault. The
                decisions now had to do more often than not with logistics - tedious little details concerning bivouac
                areas and field-kitchens - and Ce'Nedra found discussions of such matters tiresome. Those details,
                however, dictated the snail's pace of her army.
            </p>
            <p>Quite suddenly, to everyone's astonishment, King Fulrach of Sendaria became the absolute commander of the
                host. It was he who decided how far they would march each day, when they would rest and where they would
                set up each night's encampment. His authority derived directly from the fact that the supply wagons were
                his. Quite early during the march down through northern Arendia, the dumpy-looking Sendarian monarch had
                taken one look at the rather sketchy plans the Alorn kings had drawn up for feeding the troops, had
                shaken his head in disapproval, and then had taken charge of that aspect of the campaign himself.
                Sendaria was a land of farms, and her storehouses bulged. Moreover, at certain seasons, every road and
                lane in Sendaria crawled with wagons. With an almost casual efficiency, King Fulrach issued a few
                orders, and soon whole caravans of heavily laden wagons moved down through Arendia to Tolnedra and then
                turned eastward to follow the army. The pace of the army was dictated by those creaking supply wagons.
            </p>
            <p>They were only a few days into the Ulgo foothills when the full weight of King Fulrach's authority became
                clear.
            </p>
            <p>"Fulrach," King Rhodar of Drasnia objected when the King of the Sendars called a halt for yet another
                rest period, "if we don't move any faster than this, it will take us all summer to get to the eastern
                escarpment."
            </p>
            <p>"You're exaggerating, Rhodar," King Fulrach replied mildly. "We're making pretty good time. The supply
                wagons are heavy, and the wagon horses have to be rested every hour."
            </p>
            <p>"This is impossible," Rhodar declared. "I'm going to pick up the per,"</p>
            <p>"That's up to you, of course." The brown-bearded Sendar shrugged, coolly eyeing Rhodar's vast paunch.</p>
            <p>"But if you exhaust my wagon horses today, you won't eat tomorrow."</p>
            <p>And that ended that.</p>
            <p>The going in the steep passes of Ulgoland was even slower. Ce'Nedra entered that land of thick forests
                and rocky crags with apprehension. She vividly remembered the flight with Grul the Eldrak and the
                attacks of the Algroths and the Hrulgin that had so terrified her that previous winter. There were few
                meetings with the monsters that lurked in the Ulgo mountains, however. The army was so large that even
                the fiercest creatures avoided it. Mandorallen, the Baron of Vo Mandor, rather regretfully reported only
                brief sightings.
            </p>
            <p>"Mayhap if I were to ride a day's march in advance of our main force, I might find opportunity to engage
                some of the more frolicsome beasts," he mused aloud one evening, staring thoughtfully into the fire.
            </p>
            <p>"You never get enough, do you?" Barak asked him pointedly.</p>
            <p>"Never mind, Mandorallen," Polgara told the great knight. "The creatures aren't hurting us, and the Gorim
                of Ulgo would be happier if we didn't bother them."
            </p>
            <p>Mandorallen sighed.</p>
            <p>"Is he always like that?" King Anheg asked Barak curiously.</p>
            <p>"You have absolutely no idea," Barak replied.</p>
            <p>The slow march through Ulgoland, regardless of how much it chafed Rhodar, Brand, and Anheg, did, however,
                conserve the strength of the army, and they came down onto the plains of Algaria in surprisingly good
                shape.
            </p>
            <p>"We'll go on to the Algarian Stronghold," King Rhodar decided as the army poured down out of the last
                pass and fanned out across the rolling grasslands. "We need to regroup a bit, and I don't see any point
                in moving to the base of the escarpment until the engineers are ready for us. Besides, I'd prefer not to
                announce the size of our army to any Thull who happens to glance down from the top of the cliff."
            </p>
            <p>And so, in easy stages, the army marched across Algaria, trampling a mile-wide swath through the tall
                grass. Vast herds of cattle paused briefly in their grazing to watch with mild-eyed astonishment as the
                horde marched by, then returned to their feeding under the protective watch of mounted Algar clansmen.
            </p>
            <p>The encampment that was set up around the towering Stronghold in south central Algaria stretched for
                miles, and the watch fires at night seemed almost a reflection of the stars. Once she was comfortably
                quartered in the Stronghold, Princess Ce'Nedra found herself even more removed from the day-to-day
                command of her troops. Her hours seemed filled with tedium. This is not to say that she did not receive
                reports. A rigorous schedule of training was instituted, in part because large portions of the army were
                not professional soldiers, but primarily to avoid the idleness that led to discipline problems. Each
                morning, Colonel Brendig, the sober-faced Sendarian baronet who seemed utterly devoid of humor, reported
                the progress of the previous day's training with excruciating thoroughness, along with all sorts of
                other tedious little details - most of which Ce'Nedra found extremely distasteful.
            </p>
            <p>One morning after Brendig had respectfully withdrawn, Ce'Nedra finally exploded. "If he mentions the word
                'sanitation' one more time, I think I'll scream," she declared to Adara and Polgara. The princess was
                pacing up and down, flinging her arms in the air in exasperation.
            </p>
            <p>"It is fairly important in an army of this size, Ce'Nedra," Adara calmly pointed out.</p>
            <p>"But does he have to talk about it all the time? It's a disgusting subject."</p>
            <p>Polgara, who had been patiently teaching the little blond waif, Errand, how to lace up his boots, looked
                up, assessed Ce'Nedra's mood in a single glance, and then made a suggestion. "Why don't you young ladies
                take some horses and go for a ride? A bit of fresh air and exercise seems definitely to be in order."
            </p>
            <p>It took only a short while for them to find the blond Mimbrate girl, Ariana. They knew exactly where to
                look. It took a bit longer, however, to wrench her away from her rapt contemplation of Lelldorin of
                Wildantor. Lelldorin, with the aid of his cousin Torasin, was struggling to teach a group of Arendish
                serfs the basics of archery. Torasin, a fiery young Asturian patriot, had joined the army late. There
                had been,

            </p>
            <p>Ce'Nedra gathered, some unpleasantness between two young men, but the prospect of war and glory had
                finally been too much for Torasin to resist. He had overtaken the army in the western foothills of
                Ulgoland, mounted on a horse half dead from hard riding. His reconciliation with Lelldorin had been
                emotional, and now the two were closer than ever. Ariana, however, watched only Lelldorin. Her eyes
                glowed as she gazed at him with an adoration so totally mindless that it was frightening.
            </p>
            <p>The three girls, dressed in soft leather Algar riding clothes, cantered out through the encampment in
                bright midmorning sunlight, followed inevitably by Olban, youngest son of the Rivan Warder, and a
                detachment of guards. Ce'Nedra did not know exactly what to make of Olban. Since a hidden Murgo had made
                an attempt on her life in the Arendish forest, the young Rivan had appointed himself the chief of her
                personal bodyguards, and absolutely nothing could move him to abandon that duty. For some reason, he
                seemed almost grateful for the opportunity to serve, and Ce'Nedra was glumly certain that only physical
                force could make him stop.
            </p>
            <p>It was a warm, cloudless day, and the blue sky stretched over the incredible expanse of the Algarian
                plain, where tall grass bent before a vagrant breeze. Once they were out of sight of the encampment,
                Ce'Nedra's spirits rose enormously. She rode the white horse King Cho-Hag had given her, a patient,
                even-tempered animal she had named Noble. Noble was probably not a good name for him, since he was a
                lazy horse. A great part of his placidity arose from the fact that his new owner was so tiny that she
                had virtually no weight. Moreover, in an excess of affection, Ce'Nedra babied him outrageously, slipping
                apples and bits of sweets to him whenever possible. As a result of his light exercise and rich diet,
                Noble was developing a noticeable portliness.
            </p>
            <p>In the company of her two friends, and trailed by the watchful young Olban, the princess, mounted on her
                stout white horse, rode out across the grassland, exulting in the sense of freedom their ride brought to
                her.
            </p>
            <p>They reined in at the base of a long, sloping hih to rest their mounts. Noble, pumping like a bellows,
                cast a reproachful look over his shoulder at his tiny mistress, but she heartlessly ignored his unspoken
                complaint.
            </p>
            <p>"It's an absolutely wonderful day for a ride," she exclamed enthusiastically.</p>
            <p>Ariana sighed.</p>
            <p>Ce'Nedra laughed at her. "Oh, come now, it's not as if Lelldorin were going someplace, Ariana, and it's
                good for men to miss us a little once in a while."
            </p>
            <p>Ariana smiled rather wanly, then sighed again.</p>
            <p>"Perhaps it's not as good for us to miss them, however," Adara murmured without any trace of a smile.</p>
            <p>"What is that lovely fragrance?" Ce'Nedra asked suddenly.</p>
            <p>Adam lifted her porcelain face to sniff at the light breeze, then suddenly looked around as if trying to
                pinpoint their exact location. "Come with me," she said with an uncharacteristic note of command in her
                voice, and she led them around the base of the hill to the far side. About halfway up the grassy slope
                there was a patch of law, dark green bushes covered with pale lavender flowers. There had been that
                morning a hatch of blue butterflies, and the winged creatures hovered in an eostatic cloud over the
                flowers. Without pausing, Adara pressed her mount up the slope and swung down from her saddle. There
                with a low cry she knelt almost reverently, gathering the bushes in her arms as if embracing them.
            </p>
            <p>When Ce'Nedra drew closer, she was amazed to see tears welling up in her gentle friend's gray eyes,
                although Adara was actually smifing. "Whatever is wrong, Adara?" she asked.
            </p>
            <p>"They're my flowers," Adara replied in a vibrant voice. "I didn't realize that they'd grow and spread
                this way."
            </p>
            <p>"What are you talking about?"</p>
            <p>"Garion created this flower last winter just for me. There was only one - just one. I saw it come into
                existence right there in his hand. I'd forgotten it until just now. Look how far it's spread in just one
                season."
            </p>
            <p>Ce'Nedra felt a sudden pang of jealousy. Garion had never created a flower for her. She bent and pulled
                one of the lavender blooms from a bush, tugging perhaps just a bit harder than necessary. "It's
                lopsided," she sniffed, looking at the flower critically. Then she bit her lip, wishing she hadn't said
                that.
            </p>
            <p>Adara gave her a quick look of protest.</p>
            <p>"I'm only teasing, Adara," Ce'Nedra said quickly with a false little laugh. In spite of herself, still
                wanting to find something else wrong with the flower, she bent her face to the small, crooked blossom in
                her hand. Its fragrance seemed to erase all of her cares and to lift her spirits tremendously.
            </p>
            <p>Ariana had also dismounted, and she too was breathing in the gentle odor of the flowers, although there
                was a slight frown on her face. "Might I gather some few of thy blossoms, Lady Adara?" she inquired.
            </p>
            <p>"Methinks they have some strange property concealed within their blushing petals that may be of some
                interest to Lady Polgara - some healing agent too subtle for my limited familiarity with unguents and
                aromatic herbs to discern."
            </p>
            <p>Rather predictably, Ce'Nedra, having gone one way, suddenly reversed herself. "Marvelous!" she exclaimed,
                clapping her hands with delight. "Wouldn't it be wonderful if your flower turned out to be a great
                medicine, Adara? Some miraculous cure? We could call it 'Adara's rose,' and sick men would bless your
                name forever."
            </p>
            <p>"It doesn't exactly look like a rose, Ce'Nedra," Adara pointed out.</p>
            <p>"Nonsense," Ce'Nedra brushed the distinction aside. "I'm supposed to be a queen, after all, so if I say
                it's a rose, then it's a rose, and that's that. We'll take the flowers back to Lady Polgara at once."
                She turned back to her tubby horse, who was lazily regarding the flowers as if wondering whether or not
                to eat a few of them. "Come, Noble," the princess said to him with extravagant overstatement. "We'll
                gallop back to the Stronghold."
            </p>
            <p>Noble winced visibly at the word "gallop."</p>
            <p>Polgara examined the flowers carefully, but, to the disappointment of the princess and her friends, she
                would not commit herself immediately concerning their medicinal value. A bit subdued, the little
                princess returned quietly to her quarters and her duties.
            </p>
            <p>Colonel Brendig was awaiting her. Upon reflection, Ce'Nedra concluded that Colonel Brendig was by far the
                most practical man she had ever met. No detail was too small for him. In a lesser man, such concern with
                little things might have been passed off as mere fussiness, but the colonel's belief that big things
                were made up of little things gave his patient attention to detail a certain dignity. He seemed to be
                everywhere in the camp; in his wake, tent-ropes were tightened, cluttered heaps of equipment were
                arranged into neat stacks, and casually open doublets were quickly buttoned up.
            </p>
            <p>"I hope that her Majesty found her ride refreshing," the colonel said politely, bowing as Ce'Nedra
                entered the room.
            </p>
            <p>"Thank you, Colonel Brendig," the princess replied. "My majesty did." She was in a whimsical frame of
                mind, and it was always a delight to tease this sober-faced Sendar.
            </p>
            <p>A brief smile touched Brendig's lips, and then he immediately got down to the business of the midday
                report. "I'm pleased to advise your majesty that the Drasnian engineers have nearly completed the hoists
                atop the escarpment," he reported. "All that remains is the rigging of the counterweights which will
                help to lift the Cherek warships."
            </p>
            <p>"That's nice," Ce'Nedra said with the vacant, empty-headed smile she knew drove him absolutely wild.</p>
            <p>Brendig's jaw tightened slightly, but his face betrayed no other sign of his momentary flash of
                irritation.
            </p>
            <p>"The Chereks are beginning to remove the masts and rigging from their ships in preparation for the
                portage," he continued, "and the fortified positions up on top of the escarpment are several days ahead
                of schedule."
            </p>
            <p>"How wonderful!" Ce'Nedra exclaimed, clapping her hands with a great show of girlish delight.</p>
            <p>"Your Majesty, please, " Brendig complained.</p>
            <p>"I'm sorry, Colonel Brendig," Ce'Nedra apologized, affectionately patting his hand. "For some reason you
                bring out the very worst in me. Don't you ever smile?"
            </p>
            <p>He looked at her with an absolutely straight face. "I am smiling, your Majesty," he said. "Oh - you have
                a visitor from Tolnedra."
            </p>
            <p>"A visitor? Who?"</p>
            <p>"A General Varana, the Duke of Anadile."</p>
            <p>"Varana? Here? What on earth is he doing in Algaria? Is he alone?"</p>
            <p>"There are a number of other Tolnedran gentlemen with him," Brendig replied. "They aren't in uniform, but
                they have the general bearing of military men. They say that they're here as private observers. General
                Varana expressed a desire to pay his respects whenever it might be convenient."
            </p>
            <p>"Of course, Colonel Brendig," Ce'Nedra said with an enthusiasm that was no longer feigned. "Please send
                for him at once."
            </p>
            <p>Ce'Nedra had known General Varana since her earliest childhood. He was a stocky man with graying, curly
                hair and a stiff left knee that gave him a noticeable limp. He was blessed with that wry, understated
                sense of humor so characteristic of the Anadilian family. Of all the noble houses of Tolnedra, the
                Borunes were most comfortable with the Anadiles. Both families were southern, for one thing, and the
                Anadiles usually sided with the Borunes in disputes with the powerful families of the north. Although
                Anadile was only a duchy, there had never been any hint of subservience in the family's alliances with
                the Grand Dukes of the House of Borune. Indeed, Anadilian dukes, more often than not, poked gentle fun
                at their more powerful neighbors. Serious historians and statesmen had long considered it a misfortune
                for the Empire that the talented House of Anadile had not enough wealth to make a serious bid for the
                Imperial Throne.
            </p>
            <p>When General Varana politely limped into the room where Ce'Nedra impatiently awaited him, there was a
                faint smile hovering on his lips and a quizzical lift to one of his eyebrows. "Your Majesty," he greeted
                her with a bow,

            </p>
            <p>"Uncle Varana," the princess exclaimed, flying to embrace him. Varana was not, in fact, her uncle, but
                she had always thought of him as such.
            </p>
            <p>"What have you gone and done now, my little Ce'Nedra?" He laughed, enfolding her in his thick-muscled
                arms. "You're turning the world upside-down, you know. What's a Borune doing in the middle of Algaria
                with an Alorn army at her back?"
            </p>
            <p>"I'm going to invade Mishrak ac Thull," she declared impishly.</p>
            <p>"Really? Whatever for? Did King Gethell of Thulldom insult the House of Borune in some way? I hadn't
                heard about it."
            </p>
            <p>"It's an Alorn matter," Ce'Nedra replied airily.</p>
            <p>"Oh, I see. That explains it, I suppose. Alorns don't need reasons for the things they do."</p>
            <p>"You're laughing at me," she accused him.</p>
            <p>"Of course I am, Ce'Nedra. The Anadiles have been laughing at the Borunes for thousands of years."</p>
            <p>She pouted. "It's very serious, Uncle Varana."</p>
            <p>"Naturally it is," he agreed, gently touching her out-thrust lower lip with one thick finger, "but that's
                no reason not to laugh about it."
            </p>
            <p>"You're impossible," Ce'Nedra said helplessly, laughing in spite of herself. "What are you doing here?"
            </p>
            <p>"Observing," he told her. "Generals do that a lot. You've got the only war that's going on just now, so
                several of us thought we'd drop by and have a look. Morin suggested it."
            </p>
            <p>"My father's chamberlain?"</p>
            <p>"I think that's his function, yes."</p>
            <p>"Morin wouldn't do that - not on his own."</p>
            <p>"Really? What astonishing news."</p>
            <p>Ce'Nedra frowned, nibbling absently at a lock of her hair. Varana reached out and took the lock out from
                between her teeth. "Morin doesn't do anything unless my father tells him to," Ce'Nedra mused, once again
                lifting the curl to her lips.
            </p>
            <p>Varana took the lock out of her fingers again.</p>
            <p>"Don't do that," she told him.</p>
            <p>"Why not? That's the way I broke you of sucking your thumb."</p>
            <p>"This is different. I'm thinking."</p>
            <p>"Think with your mouth closed."</p>
            <p>"This was my father's idea, wasn't it?"</p>
            <p>"I wouldn't presume to say I knew the Emperor's mind," he replied.</p>
            <p>"Well, I would. What's that old fox up to?"</p>
            <p>"That's hardly respectful, child."</p>
            <p>"You say you're here to observe?''</p>
            <p>He nodded.</p>
            <p>"And perhaps make a few suggestions?"</p>
            <p>He shrugged. "If anyone cares to listen. I'm not here officially, you understand. Imperial policy forbids
                that.
            </p>
            <p>Your claim to the Riven throne is not formally recognized in Tol Honeth."</p>
            <p>She cast a sidelong glance at him through her thick eyelashes. "These suggestions you might make - if you
                happened to be near a Tolnedran legion that seemed to need a bit of direction, is it at all possible
                that one of these suggestions might be 'forward march?' "
            </p>
            <p>"That situation might arise, yes," he admitted gravely.</p>
            <p>"And you have a number of other officers of the general staff with you?"</p>
            <p>"I think several of them do, in fact, serve occasionally on that body." His eyes were twinkling with
                suppressed mirth.
            </p>
            <p>Ce'Nedra lifted the lock again, and General Varana took it away from her once more.</p>
            <p>"How would you like to meet King Rhodar of Drasnia?" she asked him.</p>
            <p>"I'd be honored to meet his Majesty."</p>
            <p>"Why don't we go see him, then?"</p>
            <p>"Why don't we?"</p>
            <p>"Oh, I love you, Uncle." She laughed, throwing her arms about him again.</p>
            <p>They found King Rhodar in conference with the other leaders of the army in a large airy chamber King
                Cho-Hag had set aside for their use. There was no longer any pretence of formality among the leaders of
                the army, and most of them sprawled in comfortable horsehide chairs, watching as the crimson-robed
                Rhodar measured off distances with a piece of string on a large map that covered one entire wall.
            </p>
            <p>"It doesn't really seem all that far to me," he was saying to King Cho-Hag.</p>
            <p>"That's because your map is flat, Rhodar," Cho-Hag replied. "The country's very hilly through there.</p>
            <p>Believe me, it will take three days."</p>
            <p>King Rhodar made an indelicate sound of disgust. "I guess we'll have to give up the idea, then. I'd like
                to burn out those forts, but I'm not going to start ordering suicide missions. Three days' ride is just
                too far."
            </p>
            <p>"Your Majesty," Ce'Nedra said politely.</p>
            <p>"Yes, child?" Rhodar was still frowning at the map.</p>
            <p>"I'd like for you to meet someone."</p>
            <p>King Rhodar turned.</p>
            <p>"Your Majesty," Ce'Nedra said formally, "may I present his Grace, the Duke of Anadile? General Varana,
                his Majesty, King Rhodar of Drasnia."
            </p>
            <p>The two men bowed politely to each other, their eyes probing, assessing.</p>
            <p>"The general's reputation precedes him," King Rhodar noted.</p>
            <p>"But his Majesty's skill as a military man has been kept a secret," Varana replied.</p>
            <p>"Do you think that satisfies the demands of courtesy?" Rhodar asked.</p>
            <p>"If not, we can both lie a little bit later on about how excruciatingly polite we were to each other,"
                Varana suggested.
            </p>
            <p>King Rhodar flashed him a quick grin. "All right, what's Tolnedra's leading tactician doing in
                Algaria?"
            </p>
            <p>"Observing, your Majesty."</p>
            <p>"You're going to stick to that story?"</p>
            <p>"Naturally. For political reasons, Tolnedra must maintain a neutral posture in this affair. I'm certain
                that Drasnian intelligence has briefed your Majesty on the realities of the situation. The five spies
                you have in the Imperial palace are thoroughly professional."
            </p>
            <p>"Six, actually," King Rhodar noted in passing.</p>
            <p>General Varana raised one eyebrow. "I suppose we should have known," he said.</p>
            <p>"It changes from time to time." Rhodar shrugged. "You know our strategic situation?"</p>
            <p>"I've been filled in, yes."</p>
            <p>"What's your assessment - as an observer?"</p>
            <p>"You're in trouble."</p>
            <p>"Thanks," Rhodar said dryly.</p>
            <p>"The numbers dictate that you take a defensive posture."</p>
            <p>Rhodar shook his head. "That might work if all we had to worry about was Taur Urgas and the Southern
                Murgos, but 'Zakath is landing more troops at Thull Zelik every day. If we fortify and try to sit tight,
                and he decides to move against us, he'll be able to bury us in Malloreans by autumn. The key to the
                whole situation is putting Anheg's fleet into the Sea of the East to stop those troop ships. We're going
                to have to gamble a bit in order to pull that off."
            </p>
            <p>Varana studied the map. "If you're going to go down the River Mardu, you'll have to neutralize the
                Thullish capital," he said, pointing at T'hull Mardu. "It's an island - like Tol Honeth - and it's right
                in the middle of the river. You'll never get a fleet past it as long as a hostile force holds it. You'll
                have to take the city."
            </p>
            <p>"That had already occurred to us," King Anheg said from where he sprawled in his chair with his
                ever-present ale cup in his hand.
            </p>
            <p>"You know Anheg?" Rhodar asked the general.</p>
            <p>Varana nodded. "By reputation," he replied. He bowed to King Anheg. "Your Majesty," he said.</p>
            <p>"General," Anheg responded, inclining his head.</p>
            <p>"If Thull Mardu is heavily defended, it will cost you a third of your army to take it," Varana
                continued.
            </p>
            <p>"We're going to lure the garrison out," Rhodar told him.</p>
            <p>"How?"</p>
            <p>"That's going to be up to Korodullin and me," King Cho-Hag said quietly. "Once we get to the top of the
                escarpment, the Mimbrate knights are going to move out and crush every city and town in the uplands, and
                my clansmen will strike down into the farming regions to burn every standing crop."
            </p>
            <p>"They'll realize that's only a diversion, your Majesty," Varana pointed out.</p>
            <p>"Naturally," Brand agreed in his rumbling voice, "but a diversion from what? We don't think they'll fully
                realize that Thull Mardu is our main objective. We'll try our best to make our depredations as general
                as possible. The loss of those towns and crops might be acceptable at first, but it won't be long before
                they'll have to take steps to protect them."
            </p>
            <p>"And you think they'll pull the garrison out of Thull Mardu to meet you?"</p>
            <p>"That's the idea," King Rhodar replied.</p>
            <p>Varana shook his head. "They'll bring Murgos up from Rak Goska and Malloreans from Thull Zelik. Then
                instead of a quick raid on Thull Mardu, you'll have a general war on your hands."
            </p>
            <p>"That's what you'd do, General Varana," King Rhodar disagreed, "but you aren't 'Zakath or Taur Urgas. Our
                strategy's based on our assessment of those two men. Neither of them will commit his forces unless he's
                convinced that we pose a major threat. Each of them wants to save as much of his army as possible. In
                their view, we're only an incidental annoyance - and an excuse to put an army into the field. For them,
                the real war starts when they attack each other. Each of them will hold back, and King Gethell of the
                Thulls will have to meet us on his own with only token support from the Murgos and the Malloreans. If we
                move fast enough, we'll have Anheg's fleet into the Sea of the East and all our troops pulled back to
                the escarpment before they realize what we're up to."
            </p>
            <p>"And then?"</p>
            <p>"And then Taur Urgas will stay in Rak Goska as if his foot were nailed to the floor." King Anheg
                chuckled.
            </p>
            <p>"I'll be in the Sea of the East drowning Malloreans by the shipload, and he'll be cheering me on every
                step of the way."
            </p>
            <p>"And 'Zakath won't dare risk those troops he already has at Thull Zelik by moving against us," Brand
                added. "If he loses too many men, Taur Urgas will have the upper hand."
            </p>
            <p>General Varana considered that. "A three-way deadlock, then," he mused. "Three armies in the same region,
                and not one of them willing to move."
            </p>
            <p>"The very best kind of war." King Rhodar grinned. "Nobody gets hurt."</p>
            <p>"Tactically, your only problem is gauging the severity of your raids before you attack Thull Mardu,"</p>
            <p>Varana noted. "They'll have to be serious enough to pull the garrison out of the city, but not so serious
                as to alarm 'Zakath or Taur Urgas. That's a very fine line to walk, gentlemen."
            </p>
            <p>Rhodar nodded. "That's why we're so delighted to have Tolnedra's foremost tactician here to advise us,"
                he said, bowing floridly.
            </p>
            <p>"Please, your Majesty," General Varana interposed, lifting one hand."Suggest, not advise. An observer can
                only suggest. The term advice implies partisanship that is not in line with the Empire's position of
                strict neutrality."
            </p>
            <p>"Ah," King Rhodar said. He turned to King Cho-Hag. "We must make arrangements for the comfort of the
                Imperial suggester and his staff," he declared with a broad grin.
            </p>
            <p>Ce'Nedra watched with secret delight as these two brilliant men began what was obviously going to be a
                firm friendship. "I'll leave you gentlemen to your entertainments," she told them. "Military discussions
                give me a headache, so I'll rely on you not to get me in trouble." She curtsied to them with a winsome
                little smile and withdrew.
            </p>
            <p>Two days later, Relg arrived from Ulgoland with the contingent of his leaf mailed countrymen sent by the
                Gorim. Taiba, who had hovered silently in the background since the army had arrived at the Stronghold,
                joined Ce'Nedra and Lady Polgara to greet the Ulgos as the wagons which carried them creaked up the hill
                toward the main gate. The beautiful Marag woman wore a plain, even severe, linen dress, but her violet
                eyes were glowing. Relg, his cowled leaf mail shirt covering his head and shoulders like lizard skin,
                climbed down from the lead wagon and only perfunctorily answered the greetings of Barak and Mandorallen.
                His large eyes searched the group gathered at the gate until they found Taiba, and then a kind of
                tension seemed to go out of him. Without speaking, he walked toward her. Their meeting was silent, and
                they did not touch, though Taiba's hand moved involuntarily toward him several times. They stood in the
                golden sunlight with their eyes lost in each other's faces, drawing about them a profound kind of
                privacy that absolutely ignored the presence of others. Taiba's eyes remained constantly on Relg's face,
                but there was in them nothing of that vacant, placid adoration that filled Ariana's eyes when she looked
                at Lelldorin.
            </p>
            <p>There was rather a question - even a challenge. Relg's answering look was the troubled gaze of a man torn
                between two overpowering compulsions. Ce'Nedra watched them for a few moments, but was finally forced to
                avert her eyes.
            </p>
            <p>The Ulgos were quartered in dim, cavernous rooms built into the foundations of the Stronghold where Relg
                could lead his countrymen through the painful process of adjusting their eyes to the light of day and
                training them to ignore the unreasoning panic which assailed all Ulgos when they were exposed to the
                open sky.
            </p>
            <p>That evening another smaller contingent arrived from the south. Three men, two in white robes and one in
                filthy rags, appeared at the gate demanding entrance. The Algars at the gate admitted them immediately,
                and one guard was sent to Lady Polgara's candlelit apartment to inform her of their arrival.
            </p>
            <p>"You'd better bring them here," she advised the poor man, who was ashen-faced and trembling. "They
                haven't been in the company of other men for a very long time, and crowds might make them nervous."
            </p>
            <p>"At once, Lady Polgara," the shaking Algar said, bowing. He hesitated for a moment. "Would he really do
                that to me?" he blurted.
            </p>
            <p>"Would who do what to you?"</p>
            <p>"The ugly one. He said that he was going to-" The man stopped, suddenly realizing to whom he was
                speaking. His face turned red. "I don't think I should repeat what he said, Lady Polgara - but it was an
                awful thing to threaten a man with."
            </p>
            <p>"Oh," she said. "I believe I know what you mean. It's one of his favorite expressions. I think you're
                safe. He only says that to get people's attention. I'm not even sure you can do it to somebody and keep
                him alive at the same time."
            </p>
            <p>"I'll bring them at once, Lady Polgara."</p>
            <p>The sorceress turned to look at Ce'Nedra, Adara, and Ariana, who had joined her for supper. "Ladies," she
                said gravely, "we're about to have guests. Two of them are the sweetest men in the world, but the third
                is a bit uncontrolled in his use of language. If you're at all sensitive about such things, you'd better
                leave."
            </p>
            <p>Ce'Nedra, remembering her encounter with the three in the Vale of Aldur, rose immediately.</p>
            <p>"Not you, Ce'Nedra," Polgara told her. "You'll have to stay, I'm afraid."</p>
            <p>Ce'Nedra swallowed hard. "I really would leave, if I were you," she advised her friends.</p>
            <p>"Is he that bad?" Adara asked. "I've heard men swear before."</p>
            <p>"Not like this one," Ce'Nedra warned.</p>
            <p>"You've managed to make me very curious." Adara smiled. "I think I'll stay."</p>
            <p>"Don't say I didn't warn you," Ce'Nedra murmured.</p>
            <p>Beltira and Belkira were as saintly as Ce'Nedra remembered them, but the misshapen Beldin was even uglier
                and nastier. Ariana fled before he had even finished greeting Lady Polgara. Adara turned deathly pale,
                but bravely kept her seat. Then the hideous little man turned to greet Ce'Nedra with a few raucous
                questions that made the princess blush to the roots of her hair. Adara prudently withdrew at that point.
            </p>
            <p>"What's wrong with your wenches, Pol?" Beldin asked innocently, scratching at his matted hair. "They
                seemed a little vaporish."
            </p>
            <p>"They're well-bred ladies, Uncle," Polgara replied. "Certain expressions are offensive to their ears."
            </p>
            <p>"Is that all?" He laughed coarsely. "This redheaded one seems a bit less delicate."</p>
            <p>"Your remarks offend me as much as they offend my companions, Master Beldin," Ce'Nedra retorted stiffly,
                "but I don't think I'll be routed by the foul mouthings of an ill-bred hunchback."
            </p>
            <p>"Not bad," he complimented her, sprawling uncouthly in a chair, "but you've got to learn to relax. An
                insult's got a certain rhythm and flow to it that you haven't quite picked up yet."
            </p>
            <p>"She's very young, Uncle," Polgara reminded him.</p>
            <p>Beldin leered at the princess. "Isn't she, though?"</p>
            <p>"Stop that," Polgara told him.</p>
            <p>"We've come-"</p>
            <p>"-to join your expedition," the twins said.</p>
            <p>"Beldin feels-"</p>
            <p>"-that you might encounter Grolims, and-"</p>
            <p>"-need our help."</p>
            <p>"Isn't that pathetic?" Beldin demanded. "They still haven't learned to talk straight." He looked at
                Polgara.
            </p>
            <p>"Is this all the army you've got?"</p>
            <p>"The Chereks will be joining us at the river," she replied.</p>
            <p>"You should have talked faster," he told Ce'Nedra. "You haven't got nearly enough men. Southern Murgos
                proliferate like maggots in dead meat, and Malloreans spawn like blowflies."
            </p>
            <p>"We'll explain our strategy to you in good time, Uncle," Polgara promised him. "We are not going to meet
                the armies of Angarak head on. What we're doing here is only diversionary."
            </p>
            <p>He grinned a hideous little grin. "I'd have given a lot to see your face when you found out that
                Belgarath had slipped away from you," he said.
            </p>
            <p>"I wouldn't dwell on that, Master Beldin," Ce'Nedra advised. "Lady Polgara was not pleased by Belgarath's
                decision, and it might not be prudent to raise it again."
            </p>
            <p>"I've seen Pol's little tantrums before." He shrugged. "Why don't you send somebody out for a pig or a
                sheep, Pol? I'm hungry."
            </p>
            <p>"It's customary to cook it first, Uncle."</p>
            <p>He looked puzzled. "What for?" he asked.</p>

        <chapter number="10">
            <p>THREE DAYS LATER the army began to move out from the Algar Stronghold toward the temporary encampment the
                Algars had erected on the east bank of the Aldur River. The troops of each nation moved in separate
                broad columns, trampling a vast track through the knee-high grass. In the center column the legions of
                Tolnedra, standards raised, marched with parade-ground perfection. The appearance of the legions had
                improved noticeably since the arrival of General Varana and his staff. The mutiny on the plains near Tol
                Vordue had given Ce'Nedra a large body of men, but no senior officers, and once the danger of surprise
                inspections was past, a certain laxity had set in. General Varana had not mentioned the rust spots on
                the breastplates nor the generally unshaven condition of the troops. His expression of mild disapproval
                had seemed to be enough. The hard-bitten sergeants who now commanded the legions had taken one look at
                his face and had immediately taken steps. The rust spots vanished, and shaving regularly once again
                became popular. There were, to be sure, a few contusions here and there on some freshly shaved faces,
                mute evidence that the heavy-fisted sergeants had found it necessary to vigorously persuade their troops
                that the holiday was over.
            </p>
            <p>To one side of the legions rode the glittering Mimbrate knights, their varicolored pennons snapping in
                the breeze from the upraised forest of their lances. Their faces shone with enthusiasm and little else.
                Ce'Nedra privately suspected that a large part of their fearsome reputation stemmed from that abysmal
                lack of anything remotely resembling thought. With only a little encouragement, a force of Mimbrates
                would cheerfully mount an assault on winter or a changing tide.
            </p>
            <p>On the other flank of the marching legions came the green - and brown - clad bowmen of Asturia. The
                placement was quite deliberate. The Asturians were no more blessed with intelligence than their Mimbrate
                cousins, and it was generally considered prudent to interpose other troops between the two Arendish
                forces to avoid unpleasantness.
            </p>
            <p>Beyond the Asturians marched the grim-faced Rivans, all in gray, and accompanying them were the few
                Chereks who were not with the fleet, which even now was in the process of being prepared for the portage
                to the base of the escarpment. Flanking the Mimbrates marched the Sendarian militiamen in their homemade
                uniforms, and at the rear of the host, the creaking lines of King Fulrach's supply wagons stretched back
                to the horizon. The Algar clans, however, did not ride in orderly columns, but rather in little groups
                and clusters as they drove herds of spare horses and half wild cattle along on the extreme flanks of the
                host.
            </p>
            <p>Ce'Nedra, in her armor and mounted on her white horse, rode in the company of General Varana. She was
                trying, without much success, to explain her cause to him.
            </p>
            <p>"My dear child," the general said finally, "I'm a Tolnedran and a soldier. Neither of those conditions
                encourages me to accept any kind of mysticism. My primary concerns at this moment have to do with
                feeding this multitude. Your supply lines stretch all the way back across the mountains and then up
                through Arendia. That's a very long way, Ce'Nedra."
            </p>
            <p>"King Fulrach's taken care of that, Uncle," she told him rather smugly. "All the time we've been
                marching, his Sendars have been freighting supplies along the Great North Road to Aldurford and then
                barging them upriver to the camp. There are whole acres of supply dumps waiting for us."
            </p>
            <p>General Varana nodded approvingly. "It appears that Sendars make perfect quartermasters," he observed.
            </p>
            <p>"Is he bringing weapons as well?"</p>
            <p>"I think they said something about that," Ce'Nedra replied. "Arrows, spare lances for the knights, that
                sort of thing. They seemed to know what they were doing, so I didn't ask too many questions."
            </p>
            <p>"That's foolish, Ce'Nedra," Varana said bluntly. "When you're running an army, you should know every
                detail."
            </p>
            <p>"I'm not running the army, Uncle," she pointed out. "I'm leading it. King Rhodar's running it."</p>
            <p>"And what will you do if something happens to him?"</p>
            <p>Ce'Nedra suddenly went cold.</p>
            <p>"You are going to war, Ce'Nedra, and people do get killed and injured in wars. You'd better start taking
                an interest in what's going on around you, my little princess. Going off to war with your head wrapped
                in a pillow isn't going to improve your chances of success, you know." He gave her a very direct look.
                "Don't chew your fingernails, Ce'Nedra," he added. "It makes your hands unsightly."
            </p>
            <p>The encampment at the river was vast, and in the very center stood King Fulrach's main supply dump, a
                virtual city of tents and neatly stacked equipment. A long string of flat-bottomed barges were moored to
                the riverbank, patiently waiting to be unloaded.
            </p>
            <p>"Your people have been busy," King Rhodar observed to the dumpy-looking Sendarian monarch as they rode
                along a narrow alleyway between mountainous heaps of canvas-covered produce and stacks of stoutly boxed
                equipment. "How did you know what to have them bring?"
            </p>
            <p>"I took notes while we were coming down through Arendia," King Fulrach replied. "It wasn't too hard to
                see what we were going to need - boots, arrows, spare swords, and the like. At present, about all we're
                bringing in is food. The Algar herds will provide fresh meat, but men get sick on a steady diet of
                nothing but meat."
            </p>
            <p>"You've already got enough food here to feed the army for a year," King Anheg noted.</p>
            <p>Fulrach shook his head. "Forty-five days," he corrected meticulously. "I want thirty days' worth here and
                two weeks' worth in the forts the Drasnians are building up on top of the escarpment. That's our margin
                of safety. As long as the barges replenish our food supplies daily, we'll always have that much on hand.
                Once you decide what your goals are, the rest is just simple mathematics."
            </p>
            <p>"How do you know how much a man's going to eat in one day?" Rhodar asked, eyeing the high-piled
                foodstuffs. "Some days I'm hungrier than others."
            </p>
            <p>Fulrach shrugged. "It averages out. Some eat more, some eat less; but in the end, it all comes out about
                the same."
            </p>
            <p>"Fulrach, sometimes you're so practical, you almost make me sick," Anheg said.</p>
            <p>"Somebody has to be."</p>
            <p>"Don't you Sendars have any sense of adventure? Don't you ever do something without planning it all out
                in advance?"
            </p>
            <p>"Not if we can help it," the King of Sendaria replied mildly.</p>
            <p>Near the center of the supply-dump a number of large pavilions had been erected for the use of the
                leaders of the army and their supporting staff. About midafternoon, after she had bathed and changed
                clothes, Princess Ce'Nedra went over to the main tent to see what was happening.
            </p>
            <p>"They're anchored about a mile downriver," Barak was reporting to his cousin. "They've been here for
                about four days now. Greldik's more or less in charge."
            </p>
            <p>"Greldik?" Anheg looked surprised. "He doesn't have any official position."</p>
            <p>"He knows the river." Barak shrugged. "Over the years he's sailed just about any place where there's
                water and a chance to make some profit. He tells me that the sailors have been drinking pretty steadily
                since they anchored. They know what's coming."
            </p>
            <p>Anheg chuckled. "We'd better not disappoint them, then. Rhodar, how much longer will it be before your
                engineers are ready to start lifting my ships ap the escarpment?"
            </p>
            <p>"A week or so," King Rhodar replied, looking up from his midafternoon snack.</p>
            <p>"It will be close enough," Anheg concluded. He turned back to Barak. "Tell Greldik that we'll start the
                portage tomorrow morning - before the sailors have time to sober up."
            </p>
            <p>Ce'Nedra had not fully understood the meaning of the word "portage" until she arrived the following
                morning at the riverbank to find the sweating Chereks hauling their ships out of the water and
                manhandling them along by main strength on wooden rollers. She was appalled at the amount of effort
                required to move a ship even a few inches.
            </p>
            <p>She was not alone in that. Durnik the smith took one shocked look at the procedure and immediately went
                looking for King Anheg. "Excuse me, your Honor," he said respectfully, "but isn't this bad for the boats
                -as well as the men?"
            </p>
            <p>"Ships," Anheg corrected. "They're called ships. A boat is something else."</p>
            <p>"Whatever you call them - won't banging them along over those logs spring their seams?"</p>
            <p>Anheg shrugged. "They all leak quite a bit anyway," he replied. "And it's always been done this way."</p>
            <p>Durnik quickly saw the futility of trying to talk to the King of Cherek. He went instead to Barak, who
                was rather glumly considering the huge ship his crew had rowed upriver to meet him. "She looks very
                impressive when she's afloat," the big red-bearded man was saying to his friend, Captain Greldik, "but I
                think she'll be even more impressive when we have to pick her up and carry her."
            </p>
            <p>"You're the one who wanted the biggest warship afloat," Greldik reminded him with a broad smirk. "You'll
                have to buy enough ale to float that whale of yours before your crew's drunk enough to try to portage
                her -
            </p>
            <p>not to mention the fact that it's customary for a captain to join in when the time comes to portage."</p>
            <p>"Stupid custom," Barak growled sourly.</p>
            <p>"I'd say that you're in for a bad week, Barak." Greldik's grin grew broader.</p>
            <p>Durnik took the two seamen aside and began talking earnestly with them, drawing diagrams on the sandy
                riverbank with a stick. The more he talked, the more interested they became.
            </p>
            <p>What emerged from their discussions a day later were a pair of lowslung cradles with a dozen wheels on
                each side. As the rest of the Chereks jeered, the two ships were carefully slid out of the water onto
                the cradles and firmly lashed in place. The jeering faded noticeably, however, when the crews of the two
                ships began trundling their craft across the plain. Hettar, who happened to ride by, watched for a few
                moments with a puzzled frown. "Why are you pulling them by hand," he asked, "when you're in the middle
                of the largest herd of horses in the world?"
            </p>
            <p>Barak's eyes went very wide, and then an almost reverent grin dawned on his face.</p>
            <p>The jeers that had risen as Barak's and Greldik's ships had been maneuvered onto their wheeled carriages
                turned rather quickly into angry mutterings as the carnages, pulled by teams of Algar horses, rolled
                effortlessly toward the escarpment past men straining with every ounce of strength to move their ships a
                few inches at a time. To leave it all to artistry, Barak and Greldik ordered their men to lounge
                indolently on the decks of their ships, drinking ale and playing dice.
            </p>
            <p>King Anheg stared very hard at his impudently grinning cousin as the big ship rolled past. His expression
                was profoundly offended. "That's going too far!" he exploded, jerking off his dented crown and throwing
                it down on the ground.
            </p>
            <p>King Rhodar put on a perfectly straight face. "I'd be the first to admit that it's probably not nearly as
                good as moving them by hand, Anheg. I'm sure there are some rather profound philosophical reasons for
                all that sweating and grunting and cursing, but it is faster, wouldn't you say? And we really ought to
                move right along with this."
            </p>
            <p>"It's unnatural," Anheg growled, still glaring at the two ships, which were already several hundred yards
                away.
            </p>
            <p>Rhodar shrugged. "Anything's unnatural the first time you try it."</p>
            <p>"I'll think about it," Anheg said darkly.</p>
            <p>"I wouldn't think for too long," Rhodar suggested. "Your popularity as a monarch is going to go downhill
                with every mile - and Barak's the sort of man who'll parade that contraption of his back and forth in
                front of your sailors every step of the way to the escarpment."
            </p>
            <p>"He would do that, wouldn't he?"</p>
            <p>"I think you can count on it."</p>
            <p>King Anheg sighed bitterly. "Go fetch that unwholesomely clever Sendarian blacksmith," he sourly
                instructed one of his men. "Let's get this over with."
            </p>
            <p>Later that day the leaders of the army gathered again in the main tent for a strategy meeting. "Our
                biggest problem now is to conceal the size of our forces," King Rhodar told them all. "Instead of
                marching everybody to the escarpment all at once and then milling around at the base of the cliff, it
                might be better to move the troops in small contingents and have them go directly up to the forts on top
                as soon as they arrive."
            </p>
            <p>"Will such a piecemeal approach not unduly delay our progress?" King Korodullin asked.</p>
            <p>"Not all that much," Rhodar replied. "We'll move your knights and Cho-Hag's clansmen up first so you can
                start burning cities and crops. That will give the Thulls something to think about beside how many
                infantry regiments we're bringing up. We don't want them to start counting noses."
            </p>
            <p>"Couldn't we build false campfires and so on to make it appear that we have more men?" Lelldorin
                suggested brightly.
            </p>
            <p>"The whole idea is to make our army appear smaller, not bigger," Brand explained gently in his deep
                voice.
            </p>
            <p>"We don't want to alarm Taur Urgas or 'Zakath sufficiently to make them commit their forces. It will be
                an
            </p>
            <p>easy campaign if all we have to deal with are King Gethell's Thulls. If the Murgos and the Malloreans
                intervene, we'll be in for a serious fight."
            </p>
            <p>"And that's the one thing we definitely want to avoid," King Rhodar added.</p>
            <p>"Oh," Lelldorin said, a bit abashed, "I didn't think of that." A slow flush rose in his cheeks.</p>
            <p>"Lelldorin," Ce'Nedra said, hoping to help him cover his embarrassment, "I think I'd like to go out and
                visit with the troops for a bit. Would you accompany me?"
            </p>
            <p>"Of course, your Majesty," the young Asturian agreed, quickly rising to his feet.</p>
            <p>"That's not a bad idea," Rhodar agreed. "Encourage them a bit, Ce'Nedra. They've walked a long way, and
                their spirits may be sagging."
            </p>
            <p>Lelldorin's cousin Torasin, dressed in his customary black doublet and hose, also rose to his feet. "I'll
                go along, if I may," he said. He grinned rather impudently at King Korodullin. "Asturians are good
                plotters, but rather poor strategists, so I probably wouldn't be able to add much to the discussions."
            </p>
            <p>The King of Arendia smiled at the young man's remark. "Thou art pert, young Torasin, but methinks thou
                art not so fervent an enemy of the crown of Arendia as thou dost pretend."
            </p>
            <p>Torasin bowed extravagantly, still grinning. Once they were outside the tent, he turned to Lelldorin. "I
                could almost learn to like that man - if it weren't for all those thees and thous," he declared.
            </p>
            <p>"It's not so bad - once you get used to it," Lelldorin replied. Torasin laughed. "If I had someone as
                pretty as Lady Ariana for a friend, she could thee me and thou me all she wanted," he said. He looked
                archly at Ce'Nedra. "Which troops did you wish to encourage, your Majesty?" he bantered.
            </p>
            <p>"Let's visit your Asturian countrymen," she decided. "I don't think I'd care to take you two into the
                Mimbrate camp - unless your swords had been taken away from you and your mouths had been bricked up."
            </p>
            <p>"Don't you trust us?" Lelldorin asked.</p>
            <p>"I know you," she replied with a little toss of her head. "Where are the Asturians encamped?"</p>
            <p>"That way," Torasin answered, pointing toward the south end of the supply dump.</p>
            <p>Smells of cooking were carried by the breeze from the Sendarian field kitchens, and those smells reminded
                the princess of something. Instead of randomly circulating among the Asturian tents, she found herself
                quite deliberately searching for some specific people.
            </p>
            <p>She found Lammer and Detton, the two serfs who had joined her army on the outskirts of Vo Wacune,
                finishing their afternoon meal in front of a patched tent. They both looked better fed than they had
                when she had first seen them, and they were no longer dressed in rags. When they saw her approaching,
                they scrambled awkwardly to their feet.
            </p>
            <p>"Well, my friends," she asked, trying to put them at ease, "how do you find army life?"</p>
            <p>"We don't have anything to complain about, your Ladyship," Detton replied respectfully.</p>
            <p>"Except for all the walking," Lammer added. "I hadn't realized that the world was this big."</p>
            <p>"They gave us boots," Detton told her, holding up one foot so that she could see his boot. "They were a
                bit stiff at first, but the blisters have all healed now."
            </p>
            <p>"Are you getting enough to eat?" Ce'Nedra asked them.</p>
            <p>"Plenty," Lammer said. "The Sendars even cook it for us. Did you know that there aren't any serfs in the
                kingdom of the Sendars, my Lady? Isn't that astonishing? It gives a man something to think about."
            </p>
            <p>"It does indeed," Detton agreed. "They grow all that food, and everybody always has plenty to eat and
                clothes to wear and a house to sleep in, and there's not a single serf in the whole kingdom."
            </p>
            <p>"I see that they've given you equipment, too," the princess said, noting that the two now wore conical
                leather helmets and stiff leather vests.
            </p>
            <p>Lammer nodded and pulled off his helmet. "It's got steel plates in it to keep a man from getting his
                brains knocked out," he told her. "They lined us all up as soon as we got here and gave every man a
                helmet and these hard leather tunics."
            </p>
            <p>"They gave each of us a spear and a dagger, too," Detton said.</p>
            <p>"Have they showed you how to use them?" Ce'Nedra asked.</p>
            <p>"Not yet, your Ladyship," Detton replied. "We've been concentrating on learning how to shoot arrows."</p>
            <p>Ce'Nedra turned to her two companions. "Could you see that somebody takes care of that?" she said. "I
                want to e sure that everybody knows how to defend himself, at least."
            </p>
            <p>"We'll see to it, your Majesty," Lelldorin answered.</p>
            <p>Not far away, a young serf was seated cross-legged in front of another tent. He lifted a handmade flute
                to his lips and began to play. Ce'Nedra had heard some of the finest musicians in the world performing
                at the palace in Tol Honeth, but the serf boy's flute caught at her heart and brought tears to her eyes.
                His melody soared toward the azure sky like an unfettered lark.
            </p>
            <p>"How exquisite," she exclaimed.</p>
            <p>Lammer nodded. "I don't know much about music," he said, "but the boy seems to play well. It's a shame
                he's not right in the head."
            </p>
            <p>Ce'Nedra looked at him sharply. "What do you mean?"</p>
            <p>"He comes from a village in the southern part of the forest of Arendia. I'm told it's a very poor village
                and that the lord of the region is very harsh with his serfs. The boy's an orphan, and he was put to
                watching the cows when he was young. One time one of the cows strayed, and the boy was beaten half to
                death. He can't talk any more."
            </p>
            <p>"Do you know his name?"</p>
            <p>"Nobody seems to know it," Detton replied. "We take turns looking out for him - making sure he's fed and
                has a place to sleep. There's not much else you can do for him."
            </p>
            <p>A small sound came from Lelldorin, and Ce'Nedra was startled to see tears streaming openly down the
                earnest young man's face.
            </p>
            <p>The boy continued his playing, his melody heartbreakingly true, and his eyes sought out Ce'Nedra's and
                met them with a kind of grave recognition.
            </p>
            <p>They did not stay much longer. The princess knew that her rank and position made the two serfs
                uncomfortable. She had made sure that they were all right and that her promise to them was being kept,
                and that was all that really mattered.
            </p>
            <p>As Ce'Nedra, Lelldorin, and Torasin walked toward the camp of the Sendars, they suddenly heard the sound
                of squabbling on the other side of a large tent.
            </p>
            <p>"I'll pile it any place I want to," one man was saying belligerently.</p>
            <p>"You're blocking the street," another man replied.</p>
            <p>"Street?" the first snorted. "What are you talking about? This isn't a town. There aren't any streets."
            </p>
            <p>"Friend," the second man explained with exaggerated patience, "we have to bring the wagons through here
                to get to the main supply dump. Now please move your equipment so I can get through. I still have a lot
                to do today."
            </p>
            <p>"I'm not going to take orders from a Sendarian teamster who's found an easy way to avoid fighting. I'm a
                soldier."
            </p>
            <p>"Really?" the Sendar replied dryly. "How much fighting have you seen?"</p>
            <p>"I'll fight when the time comes."</p>
            <p>"It may come quicker than you'd expected if you don't get your gear out of my way. If I have to get down
                off this wagon to move it myself, it's likely to make me irritable."
            </p>
            <p>"I'm all weak with fright," the soldier retorted sarcastically.</p>
            <p>"Are you going to move it?"</p>
            <p>"No."</p>
            <p>"I tried to warn you, friend," the teamster said in a resigned tone.</p>
            <p>"If you touch my gear, I'll break your head."</p>
            <p>"No. You'll try to break my head."</p>
            <p>There was a sudden sound of scuffling and several heavy blows. "Now get up and move your gear like I told
                you to," the teamster said. "I don't have all day to stand around and argue with you."
            </p>
            <p>"You hit me when I wasn't looking," the soldier complained.</p>
            <p>"Do you want to watch the next one coming?"</p>
            <p>"All right, don't get excited. I'm moving it."</p>
            <p>"I'm glad we understand each other."</p>
            <p>"Does that sort of thing happen very often?" Ce'Nedra asked quietly.</p>
            <p>Torasin, grinning broadly, nodded. "Some of your troops feel the need to bluster, your Majesty," he
                replied,
            </p>
            <p>"and the Sendarian wagoneers usually don't have the time to listen. Fistfights and streetbrawling are
                second nature to those fellows, so their squabbles with the soldiers almost always end up the same way.
                It's very educational, really."
            </p>
            <p>"Men!" Ce'Nedra said.</p>
            <p>In the camp of the Sendars they met Durnik. With him there was an oddly matched pair of young men.</p>
            <p>"A couple of old friends," Durnik said as he introduced them. "Just arrived on the supply barges. I think
                you've met Rundorig, Princess. He was at Faldor's farm when we visited there last winter."
            </p>
            <p>Ce'Nedra did in fact remember Rundorig. The tall, hulking young man, she recalled, was the one who was
                going to marry Garion's childhood sweetheart, Zubrette. She greeted him warmly and gently reminded him
                that they had met before. Rundorig's Arendish background made his mind move rather slowly. His
                companion, however, was anything but slow. Durnik introduced him as Doroon, another of Garion's boyhood
                friends. Doroon was a small, wiry young man with a protruding Adam's apple and slightly bulging eyes.
                After a few moments of shyness, his tongue began to run away with him. It was a bit hard to follow
                Doroon. His mind flitted from idea to idea, and his mouth raced along breathlessly, trying to keep up.
            </p>
            <p>"It was sort of rough going up in the mountains, your Ladyship," he replied in answer to her question
                about their trip from Sendaria, "what with how steep the road was and all. You'd think that as long as
                the Tolnedrans were building a highway, they'd have picked leveler ground - but they seem to be
                fascinated by straight lines - only that's not always the easiest way. I wonder why they're like that."
                The fact that Ce'Nedra herself was Tolnedran seemed not to have registered on Doroon.
            </p>
            <p>"You came along the Great North Road?" she asked him.</p>
            <p>"Yes - until we got to a place called Aldurford. That's a funny kind of name, isn't it? Although it makes
                sense if you stop and think about it. But that was after we got out of the mountains where the Murgos
                attacked us. You've never seen such a fight."
            </p>
            <p>"Murgos?" Ce'Nedra asked him sharply, trying to pin down his skittering thoughts.</p>
            <p>He nodded eagerly. "The man who was in charge of the wagons - he's a great big fellow from Muros, I think
                he said - wasn't it Muros he said he came from, Rundorig? Or maybe it was Camaar - for some reason I
                always get the two mixed up. What was I talking about?"
            </p>
            <p>"The Murgos," Durnik supplied helpfully.</p>
            <p>"Oh, yes. Anyway, the man in charge of the wagons said that there had been a lot of Murgos in Sendaria
                before the war. They pretended that they were merchants, but they weren't - they were spies. When the
                war started, they all went up into the mountains, and now they come out of the woods and try to ambush
                our supply wagons - but we were ready for them, weren't we Rundorig? Rundorig hit one of the Murgos with
                a big stick when the Murgo rode past our wagon - knocked him clear off his horse. Whack! Just like that!
            </p>
            <p>Knocked him clear off his horse. I'll bet he was surprised." Doroon laughed a short little laugh, and
                then his tongue raced off again, describing in jerky, helter-skelter detail the trip from Sendaria.
            </p>
            <p>Princess Ce'Nedra was strangely touched by her meeting with Garion's two old friends. She felt, moreover,
                a tremendous burden of responsibility as she realized that she had reached into almost every life in the
                west with her campaign. She had separated husbands from their wives and fathers from their children; and
                she had carried simple men, who had never been further than the next village, a thousand leagues and
                more to fight in a war they probably did not even begin to understand.
            </p>
            <p>The next morning the leaders of the army rode the few remaining leagues to the installations at the base
                of the escarpment. As they topped a rise, Ce'Nedra reined Noble in sharply and gaped in openmouthed
                astonishment as she saw the eastern escarpment for the first time. It was impossible! Nothing could be
                so vast! The great black cliff reared itself above them like an enormous wave of rock, frozen and
                forever marking the boundary between east and west, and seemingly blocking any possibility of ever
                passing in either direction. It immediately stood as a kind of stark symbol of the division between the
                two parts of the world - a division that could no more be resolved than that enormous cliff could be
                leveled.
            </p>
            <p>As they rode closer, Ce'Nedra noted a great deal of bustling activity both at the foot of the escarpment
                and along its upper rim. Great hawsers stretched down from overhead, and Ce'Nedra saw elaborately
                intertwined pulleys along the foot of the huge cliffs.
            </p>
            <p>"Why are the pulleys at the bottom?" King Anheg demanded suspiciously.</p>
            <p>King Rhodar shrugged. "How should I know? I'm not an engineer."</p>
            <p>"All right, if you're going to be that way about it, I'm not going to let your people touch a single one
                of my ships until somebody tells me why the pulleys are down here instead of up there."
            </p>
            <p>King Rhodar sighed and beckoned to an engineer who was meticulously greasing a huge pulley block.</p>
            <p>"Have you got a sketch of the rigging handy?" the portly monarch asked the grease-spattered workman.</p>
            <p>The engineer nodded, pulled a rolled sheet of grimy parchment out from under his tunic, and handed it to
                his king. Rhodar glanced at it and handed it to Anheg.
            </p>
            <p>Anheg stared at the complex drawing, struggling to trace out which line went where, and more importantly
                why it went there. "I can't read this," he complained.
            </p>
            <p>"Neither can I," Rhodar told him pleasantly, "but you wanted to know why the pulleys are down here
                instead of up there. The drawing tells you why."
            </p>
            <p>"But I can't read it."</p>
            <p>"That's not my fault."</p>
            <p>Not far away a cheer went up as a boulder half the size of a house and entwined in a nest of ropes rose
                majestically up the face of the cliff to the accompaniment of a vast creaking of hawsers.
            </p>
            <p>"You'll have to admit that that's impressive, Anheg," Rhodar said. "Particularly when you note that the
                entire rock is being lifted by those eight horses over there - with the help of that counterweight, of
                course."
            </p>
            <p>He pointed at another block of stone which was just as majestically coming down from the top of the
                escarpment.
            </p>
            <p>Anheg squinted at the two rocks. "Durnik," he said over his shoulder, "do you understand how all those
                work?"
            </p>
            <p>"Yes, King Anheg," the smith replied. "You see, the counterweight off balances the-"</p>
            <p>"Don't explain it to me, please," Anheg said. "As long as somebody I know and trust understands, that's
                all that's really important."
            </p>
            <p>Later that same day, the first Cherek ship was lifted to the top of the escarpment. King Anheg watched
                the procedure for a moment or two, then winced and turned his back. "It's unnatural," he muttered to
                Barak.
            </p>
            <p>"You've taken to using that expression a great deal lately," Barak noted.</p>
            <p>Anheg scowled at his cousin.</p>
            <p>"I just mentioned it, that's all," Barak said innocently.</p>
            <p>"I don't like changes, Barak. They make me nervous."</p>
            <p>"The world moves on, Anheg. Things change every day."</p>
            <p>"That doesn't necessarily mean that I have to like it," the King of Cherek growled. "I think I'll go to
                my tent for a drink or two."
            </p>
            <p>"Want some company?" Barak offered.</p>
            <p>"I thought you wanted to stand around and watch the world change."</p>
            <p>"It can do that without my supervision."</p>
            <p>"And probably will," Anheg added moodily. "All right, let's go. I don't want to watch this anymore." And
                the two of them went off in search of something to drink.
            </p>
        </chapter>
        <chapter number="11">
            <p>MAYASERANA, QUEEN OF Arendia, was in a pensive mood. She sat at her embroidery in the large, sunny
                nursery high in the palace at Vo Mimbre. Her infant son, the crown prince of Arendia, cooed and gurgled
                in his cradle as he played with the string of brightly colored beads that had been the ostensible gift
                of the crown prince of Drasnia. Mayaserana had never met Queen Porenn, but the shared experience of
                motherhood made her feel very close to the reputedly exquisite little blonde on her far northern throne.
            </p>
            <p>Seated in a chair not far from the queen sat Nerina, Baroness of Vo Ebor. Each lady wore velvet, the
                queen in deep purple, and the Baroness in pale blue, and each wore the high, conical white head-dress so
                admired by the Mimbrate nobility. At the far end of the nursery, an elderly lutanist softly played a
                mournful air in a minor key.
            </p>
            <p>The Baroness Nerina appeared to be even more melancholy than her queen. The circles beneath her eyes had
                grown deeper and deeper in the weeks since the departure of the Mimbrate knights, and she seldom smiled.
                Finally she sighed and laid aside her embroidery.
            </p>
            <p>"The sadness of thy heart doth resound in thy sighing, Nerina," the queen said gently. "Think not so of
                dangers and separation, lest thy spirits fail thee utterly."
            </p>
            <p>"Instruct me in the art of banishing care, Highness," Nerina replied, "for I am in sore need of such
                teaching.
            </p>
            <p>My heart is bowed beneath a burden of concern, and try though I might to control them, my thoughts, like
                unruly children, return ever to the dreadful peril of my absent lord and our dearest friend."
            </p>
            <p>"Be comforted in the knowledge that thy burden is shared by every lady in all of Mimbre, Nerina."</p>
            <p>Nerina sighed again. "My care, however, lies in more mournful certainty. Other ladies, their affections
                firm-fixed on one beloved, can dare to hope that he might return from dreadful war unscathed; but I, who
                love two, can find no reason for such optimism. I must needs lose one at the least, and the prospect
                doth crush my soul."
            </p>
            <p>There was a quiet dignity in Nerina's open acceptance of the implications of the two loves that had
                become so entwined in her heart that they could no longer be separated. Mayaserana, in one of those
                brief flashes of insight which so sharply illuminated understanding, perceived that Nerina's divided
                heart lay at the very core of the tragedy that had lifted her, her husband, and Sir Mandorallen into the
                realms of sad legend. If Nerina could but love one more than the other, the tragedy would end, but so
                perfectly balanced was her love for her husband with her love for Sir Mandorallen that she had reached a
                point of absolute stasis, forever frozen between the two of them.
            </p>
            <p>The queen sighed. Nerina's divided heart seemed somehow a symbol of divided Arendia, but, though the
                gentle heart of the suffering baroness might never be made one, Mayaserana was resolved to make a last
                effort to heal the breach between Mimbre and Asturia. To that end, she had summoned to the palace a
                deputation of the more stable leaders of the rebellious north, and her summons had appeared over a title
                she rarely used, Duchess of Asturia. At her instruction, the Asturians were even now drawing up a list
                of their grievances for her consideration.
            </p>
            <p>Later on that same sunny afternoon, Mayaserana sat alone on the double throne of Arendia, painfully aware
                of the vacancy beside her. The leader and spokesman of the group of Asturian noblemen was a Count
                Reldegen, a tall, thin man with iron gray hair and beard, who walked with the aid of a stout cane.
                Reldegen wore a rich green doublet and black hose, and, like the rest of the deputation, his sword was
                belted at his side. The fact that the Asturians came armed into the queen's presence had stirred some
                angry muttering, but Mayaserana had refused to listen to urgings that their weapons be taken from them.
            </p>
            <p>"My Lord Reldegen," the queen greeted the Asturian as he limped toward the throne.</p>
            <p>"Your Grace," he replied with a bow.</p>
            <p>"Your Majesty, " a Mimbrate courtier corrected him in a shocked voice.</p>
            <p>"Her Grace summoned us as the Duchess of Asturia," Reldegen informed the courtier coolly. "That title
                commands more respect from us than other, more recent embellishments."
            </p>
            <p>"Gentlemen, please," the queen said firmly. "Prithee, let us not commence hostilities anew. Our purpose
                here is to examine the possibilities of peace. I entreat thee, my Lord Reldegen, speak to the purpose.
            </p>
            <p>Unburden thyself of the causes of that rancor which hath so hardened the heart of Asturia. Speak freely,
                my Lord, and with no fear of reprisal for thy words." She looked quite sternly at her advisers. "It is
                our command that no man be taken to task for what is spoken here."
            </p>
            <p>The Mimbrates glowered at the Asturians, and the Asturians scowled back.</p>
            <p>"Your Grace," Reldegen began, "our chief complaint lies, I think, in the simple fact that our Mimbrate
                overlords refuse to recognize our titles. A title's an empty thing, really, but it implies a
                responsibility which has been denied to us. Most of us here are indifferent to the privileges of rank,
                but we keenly feel the

            </p>
            <p>frustration of being refused the chance to discharge our obligations. Our most talented men are compelled
                to waste their lives in idleness, and might I point out, your Grace, that the loss of that talent
                injures Arendia even more than it injures us."
            </p>
            <p>"Well spoken, my Lord," the queen murmured.</p>
            <p>"Might I respond, your Majesty," the aged, white-bearded Baron of Vo Serin inquired.</p>
            <p>"Certainly, my Lord," Mayaserana replied. "Let us all be free and open with one another."</p>
            <p>"The titles of the Asturian gentlemen are theirs for the asking," the baron declared. "For five centuries
                the crown hath awaited but the required oath of fealty to bestow them. No title may be granted or
                recognized until its owner swears allegiance to the crown."
            </p>
            <p>"Unfortunately, my Lord," Reldegen said, "we are unable to so swear. The oaths of our ancestors to the
                Duke of Asturia are still in force, and we are still bound by them."
            </p>
            <p>"The Asturian Duke of whom thou speakest died five hundred years ago," the old baron reminded him.</p>
            <p>"But his line did not die with him," Reldegen pointed out. "Her Grace is his direct descendant, and our
                pledges of loyalty are still in force."
            </p>
            <p>The queen stared first at one and then at the other. "I pray thee," she said, "correct me if my
                perception is awry. Is the import of what hath been revealed here that Arendia hath been divided for
                half a millennium by an ancient formality?"
            </p>
            <p>Reldegen pursed his lips thoughtfully. "There's a bit more to it than that, your Grace, but that does
                seem to be the core of the problem."
            </p>
            <p>"Five hundred years of strife and bloodshed over a technicality?"</p>
            <p>Count Reldegen struggled with it. He started to speak several times, but broke off each time with a look
                of helpless perplexity. In the end he began to laugh. "It is sort of Arendish, isn't it?" he asked
                rather whimsically.
            </p>
            <p>The old Baron of Vo Serin gave him a quick look, then he too began to chuckle. "I pray thee, my Lord
                Reldegen, lock this discovery in thy heart lest we all become the subject of general mirth. Let us not
                confirm the suspicion that abject stupidity is our most prevailing trait."
            </p>
            <p>"Why was this absurdity not discovered previously?" Mayaserana demanded.</p>
            <p>Count Reldegen shrugged sadly. "I suppose because Asturians and Mimbrates don't talk to each other, your
                Grace. We were always too eager to get to the fighting."
            </p>
            <p>"Very well," the queen said crisply, "what is required to rectify this sorry confusion?"</p>
            <p>Count Reldegen looked at the Baron. "A proclamation perhaps?" he suggested.</p>
            <p>The old man nodded thoughtfully. "Her Majesty could release thee from thy previous oath. It hath not been
                common practice, but there are precedents."
            </p>
            <p>"And then we all swear fealty to her as Queen of Arendia?"</p>
            <p>"That would seem to satisfy all the demands of honor and propriety."</p>
            <p>"But I'm the same person, am I not?" the queen objected.</p>
            <p>"Technically thou art not, your Majesty," the baron explained. "The Duchess of Asturia and the Queen of
                Arendia are separate entities. Thou art indeed two persons in one body."
            </p>
            <p>"This is most confusing, gentlemen," Mayaserana observed.</p>
            <p>"That's probably why no one noticed it before, your Grace," Reldegen told her. "Both you and your husband
                have two titles and two separate formal identities." He smiled briefly. "I'm surprised that there was
                room on the throne for such a crowd." His face grew serious. "It won't be a cure-all, your Grace," he
                added.
            </p>
            <p>"The divisions between Mimbre and Asturia are so deep-seated that they'll take generations to erase."</p>
            <p>"And wilt thou also swear fealty to my husband?" the queen asked.</p>
            <p>"As the King of Arendia, yes; as the Duke of Mimbre, never."</p>
            <p>"That will do for a start, my Lord. Let us see then to this proclamation. Let us with ink and parchment
                bandage our poor Arendia's most gaping wound."
            </p>
            <p>"Beautifully put, your Grace," Reldegen said admiringly.</p>
            <p>Ran Borune XXIII had spent almost his entire life inside the Imperial compound at Tol Honeth. His
                infrequent trips to the major cities of Tolnedra had, for the most part been made inside closed
                carriages. It was entirely probable that Ran Borune had never walked a continuous mile in his life, and
                a man who has not walked a mile has no real conception of what a mile is. From the very outset, his
                advisers despaired of ever making him understand the concept of distance.
            </p>
            <p>The suggestion that ultimately resolved the difficulty came from a rather surprising source. A sometime
                tutor named Jeebers - a man who had narrowly escaped imprisonment or worse the previous summer - put
                forth the suggestion diffidently. Master Jeebers now did everything diffidently. His near brush with
                Imperial displeasure had forever extinguished the pompous self importance that had previously marred his
                character. A number of his acquaintances were surprised to discover that they even liked the balding,
                skinny man now.
            </p>
            <p>Master Jeebers had pointed out that if the Emperor could only see things in exact scale, he might then
                understand. Like so many good ideas that had surfaced from time to time in Tolnedra, this one
                immediately got out of hand. An entire acre of the Imperial grounds was converted into a scale replica
                of the border region of eastern Algaria and the opposing stretches of Mishrak ac Thull. To give it all
                perspective, a number of inch-high human figures were cast in lead to aid the Emperor in conceptualizing
                the field of operations.
            </p>
            <p>The Emperor immediately announced that he'd really like to have more of the lead figures to aid his
                understanding of the masses of men involved, and a new industry was born in Tol Honeth. Overnight lead
                became astonishingly scarce.
            </p>
            <p>In order that he might better see the field, the Emperor mounted each morning to the top of a
                thirty-foot-high tower that had hastily been erected for that purpose. There, with the aid of a
                great-voiced sergeant of the Imperial guard, the Emperor deployed his leaden regiments of infantry and
                cavalry in precise accordance with the latest dispatches from Algaria.
            </p>
            <p>The general staff very nearly resigned their commissions en masse. They were, for the most part, men of
                advanced middle age, and joining the Emperor atop his tower each morning involved some strenuous
                climbing. They all tried at various times to explain to the beak-nosed little man that they could see
                just as well from the ground, but Ran Borune would have none of it.
            </p>
            <p>"Morin, he's killing us," one portly general complained bitterly to the Emperor's chamberlain. "I'd
                rather go off to war than climb that ladder four times a day."
            </p>
            <p>"Move the Drasnian pikemen four paces to the left!" the sergeant bellowed from the top of the tower, and
                a dozen men on the ground began redeploying the tiny lead figures.
            </p>
            <p>"We all must serve in the capacity our Emperor chooses for us," Lord Morin replied philosophically.</p>
            <p>"I don't see you climbing the ladder," the general accused.</p>
            <p>"Our Emperor has chosen another capacity for me," Morin said rather smugly.</p>
            <p>That evening the weary little Emperor sought his bed. "It's very exciting, Morin," he murmured drowsily,
                holding the velvet-lined case that contained the solid gold figures representing Ce'Nedra and Rhodar and
                the rest of the army's leaders close to.his chest, "but it's very tiring, too."
            </p>
            <p>"Yes, your Majesty."</p>
            <p>"There always seems to be so much that I still have to do."</p>
            <p>"That's the nature of command, your Majesty," Morin observed. But the Emperor had already dropped off.
            </p>
            <p>Lord Morin removed the case from the Emperor's hands and carefully pulled the covers up around the
                sleeping man's shoulders. "Sleep, Ran Borune," he said very gently. "You can play with your little toy
                soldiers again tomorrow."
            </p>
            <p>Sadi the eunuch had quietly left the palace at Sthiss Tor by a secret doorway that opened behind the
                slaves'
            </p>
            <p>quarters onto a shabby back street that twisted and turned in the general direction of the harbor. He had
                quite deliberately waited for the cover of the afternoon rainstorm and had dressed himself in the shabby
                clothing of a dockworker. Accompanying him was the one-eyed assassin, Issus, who also wore nondescript
                clothing. Sadi's security precautions were routine, but his choice of Issus as his companion was not.
                Issus was not a member of the palace guard nor of Sadi's personal retinue, but Sadi was not concerned on
                this afternoon's outing with appearances or proprieties. Issus was by and large uncorrupted by palace
                politics and had a reputation for unswerving loyalty to whomever was paying him at the moment.
            </p>
            <p>The two passed down the rainswept street to a certain disreputable establishment frequented by
                lower-class workers, and went through a rather noisy taproom to the maze of cubicles at the back, where
                other entertainments were provided. At the end of a foul-smelling hallway, a lean, hard-eyed woman,
                whose arms were covered from wrist to elbow with cheap, gaudy bracelets, pointed wordlessly at a scarred
                door, then turned abruptly and disappeared through another doorway.
            </p>
            <p>Behind the door lay a filthy room with only a bed for furniture. On the bed were two sets of clothing
                that smelled of tar and salt water, and sitting on the floor were two large tankards of lukewarm ale.
                Wordlessly, Sadi and Issus changed clothes. From beneath the soiled pillow, Issus pulled a pair of wigs
                and two sets of false whiskers.
            </p>
            <p>"How can they drink this?" Sadi demanded, sniffing at one of the tankards and wrinkling his nose.</p>
            <p>Issus shrugged. "Alorns have peculiar tastes. You don't have to drink it all, Sadi. Splash most of it on
                your clothes. Drasnian sailors spill a lot of ale when they're out in search of amusement. How do I
                look?"
            </p>
            <p>Sadi gave him a quick glance. "Ridiculous," he replied. "Hair and a beard don't really suit you,
                Issus."
            </p>
            <p>Issus laughed. "And they look particularly out of place on you. " He shrugged and carefully poured ale
                down the front of his tar-spattered tunic. "I suppose we look enough like Drasnians to get by, and we
                certainly smell like Drasnians. Hook your beard on a little tighter, and let's get moving before it
                stops raining."
            </p>
            <p>"Are we going out the back?"</p>
            <p>Issus shook his head. "If we're being followed, the back will be watched. We'll leave the way ordinary
                Drasnian sailors leave."
            </p>
            <p>"And how is that?"</p>
            <p>"I've made arrangements to have us thrown out."</p>
            <p>Sadi had never been thrown out of any place before, and he found the experience not particularly
                amusing.
            </p>
            <p>The two burly ruffians who unceremoniously pitched him into the street were a bit rough about it, and
                Sadi picked up several scrapes and abrasions in the process.
            </p>
            <p>Issus staggered to his feet and stood bawling curses at the closed door, then lurched over and pulled
                Sadi up out of the mud. Together they reeled in apparent drunkenness down the street toward the Drasnian
                enclave.
            </p>
            <p>Sadi noted that there had been two men in a doorway across the street when he and Issus had been ejected
                and that the two did not move to follow.
            </p>
            <p>Once they entered the Drasnian enclave, Issus led the way rather quickly to the house of Droblek, the
                Drasnian port authority. They were admitted immediately and conveyed at once to a dimly lighted but
                comfortable room where the enormously fat Droblek sat sweating. With him was Count Melgon, the
                aristocratic ambassador from Tolnedra.
            </p>
            <p>"Novel attire for the chief eunuch of Salmissra's household," Count Melgon observed as Sadi pulled off
                his wig and false beard.
            </p>
            <p>"Just a bit of deception, my Lord Ambassador," Sadi replied. "I didn't particularly want this meeting to
                become general knowledge."
            </p>
            <p>"Can he be trusted?" Droblek asked bluntly, pointing at Issus.</p>
            <p>Sadi's expression became whimsical. "Can you be trusted, Issus?" he asked.</p>
            <p>"You've paid me for up to the end of the month." Issus shrugged. "After that, we'll see. I might get a
                better offer."
            </p>
            <p>"You see?" Sadi said to the two seated men. "Issus can be trusted until the end of the month - at least
                as much as anybody in Sthiss Tor can be trusted. One thing I've noticed about Issus - he's a simple,
                uncomplicated man. Once you buy him, he stays bought. I think it's referred to as professional ethics."
            </p>
            <p>Droblek grunted sourly. "Do you suppose we could get to the point? Why did you go to so much trouble to
                arrange this meeting? Why didn't you just summon us to the palace?"
            </p>
            <p>"My dear Droblek," Sadi murmured, "you know the kind of intrigue that infests the palace. I'd prefer that
                what passes between us remain more or less confidential. The matter itself is rather uncomplicated. I've
                been approached by the emissary of Taur Urgas."
            </p>
            <p>The two regarded him with no show of surprise.</p>
            <p>"I gather that you already knew."</p>
            <p>"We're hardly children, Sadi," Count Melgon told him.</p>
            <p>"I am at present in negotiations with the new ambassador from Rak Goska," Sadi mentioned.</p>
            <p>"Isn't that the third one so far this summer?" Melgon asked.</p>
            <p>Sadi nodded. "The Murgos seem to be particularly susceptible to certain fevers which abound in the
                swamps."
            </p>
            <p>"We've noticed that," Droblek said dryly. "What is your prognosis for the present emissary's continued
                good health?"
            </p>
            <p>"I don't imagine he's any more immune than his countrymen. He's already beginning to feel unwell."</p>
            <p>"Maybe he'll be lucky and recover," Droblek suggested.</p>
            <p>"Not very likely," Issus said with an ugly laugh.</p>
            <p>"The tendency of Murgo ambassadors to die unexpectedly has succeeded in keeping the negotiations moving
                very slowly," Sadi continued. "I'd like for you gentlemen to inform King Rhodar and Ran Borune that
                these delays will probably continue."
            </p>
            <p>"Why?" Droblek asked.</p>
            <p>"I want them to understand and appreciate my efforts in their present campaign against the Angarak
                kingdoms."
            </p>
            <p>"Tolnedra has no involvement in that campaign," Melgon asserted quickly.</p>
            <p>"Of course not." Sadi smiled.</p>
            <p>"Just how far are you willing to go, Sadi?" Droblek asked curiously.</p>
            <p>"That depends almost entirely upon who's winning at any given moment," Sadi replied urbanely. "If the
                Rivan Queen's campaign in the east begins to run into difficulties, I suspect that the pestilence will
                subside and the Murgo emissaries will stop dying so conveniently. I'd almost have to make an
                accommodation with Taur Urgas at that point."
            </p>
            <p>"Don't you find that just a bit contemptible, Sadi?" Droblek asked acidly.</p>
            <p>Sadi shrugged. "We're a contemptible sort of people, Droblek," he admitted, "but we survive. That's no
                mean accomplishment for a weak nation lying between two major powers. Tell Rhodar and Ran Borune that
                I'll stall the Murgos off for as long as things continue to go in their favor. I want them both to be
                aware of their obligation to me."
            </p>
            <p>"And will you advise them when your position is about to change?" Melgon asked.</p>
            <p>"Of course not," Sadi replied. "I'm corrupt, Melgon. I'm not stupid."</p>
            <p>"You're not much of an ally, Sadi," Droblek told him.</p>
            <p>"I never pretended to be. I'm looking out for myself. At the moment, my interests and yours happen to
                coincide, that's all. I do, however, expect to be remembered for my assistance."
            </p>
            <p>"You're trying to play it both ways, Sadi," Droblek accused him bluntly.</p>
            <p>"I know." Sadi smiled. "Disgusting, isn't it?"</p>
            <p>Queen Islena of Cherek was in an absolute panic. This time Merel had gone too far. The advice they had
                received from Porenn had seemed quite sound - had indeed raised the possibility of a brilliant stroke
                which would disarm Grodeg and the Bear-cult once and for all. The imagined prospect of the helpless rage
                into which this would plummet the towering ecclesiast was almost a satisfaction in itself. Like so many
                people, Queen Islena took such pleasure in an imagined triumph that the real thing became almost too
                much trouble. The victories of the imagination involved no risks, and a confrontation with an enemy
                always ended satisfactorily when both sides of the conversation came from one's own daydreams. Left to
                her own devices, Islena would probably have been content to let it go at that.
            </p>
            <p>Merel, however, was less easily satisfied. The plan devised by the little queen of Drasnia had been quite
                sound, but it suffered from one flaw - they did not have enough men to bring it off. Merel, however, had
                located an ally with certain resources and had brought him into the queen's inner circle. A group of men
                in Cherek had not accompanied Anheg and the fleet to Algaria largely because they were not the sort of
                men who made good sailors. At Merel's stern-faced insistence, the Queen of Cherek suddenly developed an
                overpowering enthusiasm for hunting. It was in the forest, safe from prying ears, that the details of
                the coup were worked out.
            </p>
            <p>"When you kill a snake, you cut off its head," Torvik the huntsman had pointed out as he, Merel, and
                Islena sat in a forest glade while Torvik's men roved through the woods harvesting enough game to make
                it appear that Islena had spent her day in a frenzy of slaughter. "You don't accomplish all that much by
                snipping pieces off its tail an inch or so at a time," the broad-shouldered huntsman continued. "The
                Bear-cult isn't really that concentrated in one place. With a little luck, we can gather up all the
                important members presently in Val Alorn in one sweep. That should irritate our snake enough to make him
                stick his neck out.
            </p>
            <p>Then we'll simply chop off his head."</p>
            <p>Torvik's use of such terminology had made the queen wince. She had not been entirely sure that the blunt,
                grizzled forester had been speaking figuratively.
            </p>
            <p>And now it had been done. Torvik and his huntsmen had moved quietly through the dark streets of Val Alorn
                for the entire night, gathering up the sleeping members of the Bear-cult, marching them in groups to the
                harbor and then locking them in the holds of waiting ships. Because of their years of experience, the
                hunters had been very thorough in rounding up their quarry. By morning, the only members of the
                Bear-cult left in the city were the High Priest of Belar and the dozen or so underpriests lodged in the
                temple.
            </p>
            <p>Queen Islena sat, pale and trembling, on the throne of Cherek. She wore her purple gown and her gold
                crown. In her hand she held a scepter. The scepter had a comforting weight to it and could possibly be
                used as a weapon in an emergency. The queen was positive that an emergency was about to descend on her.
            </p>
            <p>"This is all your fault, Merel," she bitterly accused her blond friend. "If you'd just left things alone,
                we wouldn't be in this mess."
            </p>
            <p>"We'd be a worse one," Merel replied coldly. "Pull yourself together, Islena. It's done now, and you
                can't undo it."
            </p>
            <p>"Grodeg terrifies me," Islena blurted.</p>
            <p>"He won't be armed. He won't be able to hurt you."</p>
            <p>"I'm only a woman," Islena quailed. "He'll roar at me in that awful voice of his, and I'll go absolutely
                to pieces."
            </p>
            <p>"Stop being such a coward, Islena," Merel snapped. "Your timidity's brought Cherek right to the edge of
                disaster. Every time Grodeg's raised his voice to you, you've given him anything he wanted just because
                you're afraid of harsh talk. Are you a child? Does noise frighten you that much?"
            </p>
            <p>"You forget yourself, Merel," Islena flared suddenly. "I am queen, after alL"</p>
            <p>"Then by all the Gods, be queen! Stop behaving like a silly, frightened serving girl. Sit up straight on
                your throne as if you had some iron in your backbone - and pinch your cheeks. You're as pale as a
                bedsheet."
            </p>
            <p>Merel's face hardened. "Listen to me, Islena," she said. "If you give even one hint that you're starting
                to weaken, I'll have Torvik run his spear into Grodeg right here in the throne room."
            </p>
            <p>"You wouldn't!" Islena gasped. "You can't kill a priest."</p>
            <p>"He's a man just like any other man," Merel declared harshly. "If you stick a spear in his belly, he'll
                die."
            </p>
            <p>"Not even Anheg would dare to do that."</p>
            <p>"I'm not Anheg."</p>
            <p>"You'll be cursed!"</p>
            <p>"I'm not afraid of curses."</p>
            <p>Torvik came into the throne room, a broad-bladed boarspear held negligently in one big hand. "He's
                coming," he announced laconically.
            </p>
            <p>"Oh, dear," Islena quavered.</p>
            <p>"Stop that!" Merel snapped.</p>
            <p>Grodeg was livid with rage as he strode into the throne room. His white robe was rumpled as if he had
                thrown it on hastily, and his white hair and beard were uncombed. "I will speak with the queen alone!"
                he thundered as he approached across the rush-strewn floor.
            </p>
            <p>"That is the queen's decision to make, not yours, my Lord High Priest," Merel advised him in a flinty
                voice.
            </p>
            <p>"Does the wife of the Earl of Trellheim speak for the throne?" Grodeg demanded of Islena.</p>
            <p>Islena faltered, then saw Torvik standing directly behind the tall priest. The boarspear in his hand was
                no longer so negligently grasped. "Calm yourself, revered Grodeg," the queen said, quite suddenly
                convinced that the life of the infuriated priest hinged not only on her words but even on her tone of
                voice. At the

            </p>
            <p>tiniest quaver, Merel would give the signal, and Torvik would sink that broad, sharp blade into Grodeg's
                back with about as much emotion as he showed about swatting a fly.
            </p>
            <p>"I want to see you alone," Grodeg repeated stubbornly. "</p>
            <p>"No."</p>
            <p>"No?" he roared incredulously.</p>
            <p>"You heard me, Grodeg," she told him. "And stop shouting at me. My hearing is quite good."</p>
            <p>He gaped at her, then quickly recovered. "Why have all my friends been arrested?" he demanded.</p>
            <p>"They were not arrested, my Lord High Priest," the queen replied. "They have all volunteered to join my
                husband's fleet."
            </p>
            <p>"Ridiculous!" he snorted.</p>
            <p>"I think you'd better choose your words a bit more carefully, Grodeg," Merel told him. "The queen's
                patience with your impertinence is wearing thin."
            </p>
            <p>"Impertinence?" he exclaimed. "How dare you speak that way to me?" He drew himself up and fixed a stern
                eye on the queen. "I insist upon a private audience," he told her in a thunderous voice.
            </p>
            <p>The voice which had always cowed her before quite suddenly irritated Islena. She was trying to save this
                idiot's life, and he kept shouting at her. "My Lord Grodeg," she said with an unaccustomed hint of steel
                in her voice, "if you bellow at me one more time, I'll have you muzzled."
            </p>
            <p>His eyes widened in amazement.</p>
            <p>"We have nothing to discuss in private, my Lord," the queen continued. "All that remains is for you to
                receive your instructions - which you will follow to the letter. It is our decree that you will proceed
                directly to the harbor, where you will board the ship which is waiting to transport you to Algaria.
                There you will join the forces of Cherek in the campaign against the Angaraks."
            </p>
            <p>"I refuse!" Grodeg retorted.</p>
            <p>"Think carefully, my Lord Grodeg," Merel purred. "The queen has given you a royal command. Refusal could
                be considered treason."
            </p>
            <p>"I am the High Priest of Belar," Grodeg ground out between clenched teeth, obviously having great
                difficulty in modulating his voice. "You wouldn't dare ship me off like some peasant conscript."
            </p>
            <p>"I wonder if the High Priest of Belar might like to make a small wager on that," Torvik said with
                deceptive mildness. He set the butt of his spear on the floor, took a stone from the pouch at his belt
                and began to hone the already razor-sharp blade. The steely sound had an obviously chilling effect on
                Grodeg.
            </p>
            <p>"You will go to the harbor now, Grodeg," Islena told him, "and you will get on that ship. If you do not,
                you will go to the dungeon, where you will keep the rats company until my husband returns. Those are
                your choices; join Anheg or join the rats. Decide quickly. You're starting to bore me, and quite
                frankly, I'm sick of the sight of you."
            </p>
            <p>Queen Porenn of Drasnia was in the nursery, ostensibly feeding her infant son. Out of respect for the
                queen's person, she was unspied upon while she was nursing. Porenn, however, was not alone. Javelin, the
                bone-thin chief of Drasnian intelligence, was with her. For the sake of appearance, Javelin was dressed
                in a serving maid's gown and cap, and he looked surprisingly feminine in the disguise he wore with no
                apparent trace of self consciousness.
            </p>
            <p>"Are there really that many cultists in the intelligence service?" the queen asked, a little dismayed.
            </p>
            <p>Javelin sat with his back politely turned. "I'm afraid so, your Highness. We should have been more alert,
                but we had other things on our minds."
            </p>
            <p>Porenn thought about it for a moment, unconsciously rocking her suckling baby. "Islena's moving already,
                isn't she?" she asked.
            </p>
            <p>"That's the word I received this morning," Javelin replied. "Grodeg's on his way to the mouth of the
                Aldur River already, and the queen's men are moving out into the countryside, rounding up every member
                of the cult as they go."
            </p>
            <p>"Will it in any way hamper our operations to jerk that many people out of Boktor?"</p>
            <p>"We can manage, your Highness," Javelin assured her. "We might have to speed up the graduation of the
                current class at the academy and finish their training on the job, but we'll manage."
            </p>
            <p>"Very well then, Javelin," Porenn decided. "Ship them all out. Get every cult member out of Boktor, and
                separate them. I want them sent to the most miserable duty posts you can devise, and I don't want any of
                them within fifty leagues of any other one. There will be no excuses, no sudden illnesses, and no
                resignations. Give each of them something to do, and then make him do it. I want every Bear-cultist
                who's crept into the intelligence service out of Boktor by nightfall."
            </p>
            <p>"It will be my pleasure, Porenn," Javelin said. "Oh, incidentally, that Nadrak merchant, Yarblek is back
                from Yar Nadrak, and he wants to talk to you about the salmon runs again. He seems to have this
                obsessive interest in fish."
            </p>
        </chapter>
        <chapter number="12">
            <p>THE RAISING OF the Cherek fleet to the top of the eastern escarpment took a full two weeks, and King
                Rhodar chafed visibly at the pace of the operation.
            </p>
            <p>"You knew this was going to take time, Rhodar," Ce'Nedra said to him as he fumed and sweated, pacing back
                and forth with frequent dark looks at the towering cliff face. "Why are you so upset?"
            </p>
            <p>"Because the ships are right out in the open, Ce'Nedra," he replied testily. "There's no way to hide them
                or disguise them while they're being raised. Those ships are the key to our whole campaign, and if
                somebody on the other side starts putting a few things together, we might have to meet all of Angarak
                instead of just the Thulls."
            </p>
            <p>"You worry too much," she told him. "Cho-Hag and Korodullin are burning everything in sight up there.</p>
            <p>'Zakath and Taur Urgas have other things to think about beside what we're hauling up the cliff."</p>
            <p>"It must be wonderful to be so unconcerned about things," he said sarcastically.</p>
            <p>"Be nice, Rhodar," she said.</p>
            <p>General Varana, still scrupulously dressed in his Tolnedran mantle, limped toward them with that
                studiously diffident expression that indicated he was about to make another suggestion.
            </p>
            <p>"Varana," King Rhodar burst out irritably, "why don't you put on your uniform?"</p>
            <p>"Because I'm not really officially here, your Majesty," the general replied calmly. "Tolnedra is neutral
                in this affair, you'll recall."
            </p>
            <p>"That's a fiction, and we all know it."</p>
            <p>"A necessary one, however. The Emperor is still holding diplomatic channels open to Taur Urgas and</p>
            <p>'Zakath. Those discussions would deteriorate if someone saw a Tolnedran general swaggering around in full
                uniform." He paused briefly. "Would a small suggestion offend your Majesty?" he asked.
            </p>
            <p>"That all depends on the suggestion," Rhodar retorted. Then he made a face and apologized. "I'm sorry,
                Varana. This delay's making me bad-tempered. What did you have in mind?"
            </p>
            <p>"I think you might want to give some thought to moving your command operations up to the top about now.
                You'll want things running smoothly by the time the bulk of your infantry arrives, and it usually takes
                a couple of days to iron out the wrinkles when you set things up."
            </p>
            <p>King Rhodar stared at a Cherek ship being hoisted ponderously up the cliff face. "I'm not going to ride
                up on one of those, Varana," he declared flatly.
            </p>
            <p>"It's absolutely safe, your Majesty," Varana assured him. "I've made the trip myself several times. Even
                Lady Polgara went up that way just this morning."
            </p>
            <p>"Polgara could fly down if something went wrong," Rhodar said. "I don't have her advantages. Can you
                imagine the size of the hole I'd make in the ground if I fell that far?"
            </p>
            <p>"The alternative is extremely strenuous, your Majesty. There are several ravines running down from the
                top. They've been leveled out a bit so that the horses can go up, but they're still very steep."
            </p>
            <p>"A little sweating won't hurt me."</p>
            <p>Varana shrugged. "As your Majesty wishes."</p>
            <p>"I'll keep you company, Rhodar," Ce'Nedra offered brightly. He gave her a suspicious look.</p>
            <p>"I don't really trust machines either," she confessed. "I'll go change clothes, and then we can start."
            </p>
            <p>"You want to do it today?" His voice was plaintive.</p>
            <p>"Why put it off?"</p>
            <p>"I can think of a dozen reasons."</p>
            <p>The term "very steep" turned out to be a gross understatement. "Precipitous" might have been more
                accurate. The incline made riding horses out of the question, but ropes had been strung along the
                steeper stretches to aid in the climb. Ce'Nedra, dressed in one of her short Dryad tunics, scampered
                hand over hand up the ropes with the agility of a squirrel. King Rhodar's pace, however, was much
                slower.
            </p>
            <p>"Please stop groaning, Rhodar," she told him after they had climbed for an hour or so. "You sound like a
                sick cow."
            </p>
            <p>"That's hardly fair, Ce'Nedra," he wheezed, stopping to mop his streaming face.</p>
            <p>"I never promised to be fair," she retorted with an impish grin. "Come along, we still have a long way to
                go." And she flitted up another fifty yards or so.
            </p>
            <p>"Don't you think you're a little underdressed?" he puffed disapprovingly, staring up at her. "Proper
                ladies don't show off so much leg."
            </p>
            <p>"What's wrong with my legs?"</p>
            <p>"They're bare - that's what's wrong with them."</p>
            <p>"Don't be such a prig. I'm comfortable. That's all that matters. Are you coming or not?"</p>
            <p>Rhodar groaned again. "Isn't it almost time for lunch?"</p>
            <p>"We just had lunch."</p>
            <p>"Did we? I'd forgotten already."</p>
            <p>"You always seem to forget your last meal - usually before the crumbs have been brushed away."</p>
            <p>"That's the nature of a fat man, Ce'Nedra." He sighed. "The last meal is history. It's the next one
                that's important." He stared mournfully up the brutal trail ahead and groaned again.
            </p>
            <p>"This was all your idea," she heartlessly reminded him.</p>
            <p>The sun was low in the west when they reached the top. As King Rhodar collapsed, Princess Ce'Nedra looked
                around curiously. The fortifications which had been erected along the top of the escarpment were
                extensive and quite imposing. The walls were of earth and stone and were perhaps thirty feet high.
                Through an open gate the princess saw a series of other, lower walls, each fronted by a ditch bristling
                with sharpened stakes and thorny brambles. At various points along the main wall rose imposing
                blockhouses, and within the walls were neat rows of huts for the soldiers.
            </p>
            <p>The forts swarmed with men, and their various activities raised an almost perpetual cloud of dust. A
                party of Algar clansmen, smokestained and mounted on spent-looking horses, rode slowly in through the
                gate; and a few moments later, a contingent of gleaming Mimbrate knights, pennons snapping from their
                lances and the great hoofs of their chargers clattering on the stony ground, rode out in search of yet
                another town to destroy.
            </p>
            <p>The huge hoists at the edge of the escarpment creaked and groaned under the weight of the Cherek ships
                being raised from the plain below; some distance away, within the fortified walls, the growing fleet sat
                awaiting the final portage to the headwaters of the upper River Mardu, some fifty leagues distant.
            </p>
            <p>Polgara, accompanied by Durnik and the towering Barak, approached to greet the princess and the prostrate
                King of Drasnia.
            </p>
            <p>"How was the climb?" Barak inquired.</p>
            <p>"Ghastly," Rhodar wheezed. "Does anybody have anything to eat? I think I've melted off about ten
                pounds."
            </p>
            <p>"It doesn't show," Barak told him.</p>
            <p>"That sort of exertion isn't really good for you, Rhodar," Polgara told the gasping monarch. "Why were
                you so stubborn about it?"
            </p>
            <p>"Because I have an absolute horror of heights," Rhodar replied. "I'd climb ten times as far to avoid
                being hauled up that cliff by those contraptions. The idea of all that empty air under me makes my flesh
                creep."
            </p>
            <p>Barak grinned. "That's a lot of creeping."</p>
            <p>"Will somebody please give me something to eat?" Rhodar asked in an anguished tone of voice.</p>
            <p>"A bit of cold chicken?" Durnik offered solicitously, handing him a well-browned chicken leg.</p>
            <p>"Where did you ever find a chicken?" Rhodar exclaimed, eagerly seizing the leg.</p>
            <p>"The Thulls brought some with them," Durnik told him.</p>
            <p>"Thulls?" Ce'Nedra gasped. "What are Thulls doing here?"</p>
            <p>"Surrendering," Durnik replied. "Whole villages of them have been showing up for the past week or so.</p>
            <p>They walk up to the edge of the ditches along the front of the fortification and sit down and wait to be
                captured. They're very patient about it. Sometimes it's a day or so before anybody has the time to go
                out and capture them, but they don't seem to mind."
            </p>
            <p>"Why do they want to be captured?" Ce'Nedra asked him.</p>
            <p>"There aren't any Grolims here," Durnik explained. "No altars to Torak and no sacrificial knives. The
                Thulls seem to feel that getting away from that sort of thing is worth the inconvenience of being
                captured.
            </p>
            <p>We take them in and put them to work on the fortifications. They're good workers, if you give them the
                proper supervision."
            </p>
            <p>"Is that entirely safe?" Rhodar asked around a mouthful of chicken. "There might be spies among them."
            </p>
            <p>Durnik nodded. "We know," he said, "but the spies are usually Grolims. A Thull doesn't have the mental
                equipment to be a spy, so the Grolims have to do it themselves."
            </p>
            <p>Rhodar lowered his chicken leg in astonishment. "You're letting Grolims inside the fortifications?" he
                demanded.
            </p>
            <p>"It's nothing all that serious," Durnik told him. "The Thulls know who the Grolims are, and we let them
                deal with the problem. They usually take them a mile or so along the escarpment and then throw them off.
            </p>
            <p>At first they wanted to do it right here, but some of their elders pointed out that it might not be
                polite to
            </p>
            <p>drop Grolims down on top of the men working below, so they take them some place where they won't bother
                anybody when they fall. A very considerate people, the Thulls. One could almost get to like them."
            </p>
            <p>"You've sunburned your nose, Ce'Nedra," Polgara told the little princess. "Didn't you think of wearing a
                hat?"
            </p>
            <p>"Hats give me a headache." Ce'Nedra shrugged. "A little sunburn won't hurt me."</p>
            <p>"You have an appearance to maintain, dear," Polgara pointed out. "You're not going to look very queenly
                with your nose peeling."
            </p>
            <p>"It's nothing to worry about, Lady Polgara. You can fix it, can't you? You know-" Ce'Nedra made a little
                gesture with her hand that was meant to look magical.
            </p>
            <p>Polgara gave her a long, chilly look.</p>
            <p>King Anheg of Cherek, accompanied by the broad-shouldered Rivan Warder, approached them. "Did you have a
                nice climb?" he asked Rhodar pleasantly.
            </p>
            <p>"How would you like a punch in the nose?" Rhodar asked him. King Anheg laughed coarsely.</p>
            <p>"My," he said, "aren't we grumpy today? I've just had some news from home that ought to brighten your
                disposition a bit."
            </p>
            <p>"Dispatches?" Rhodar groaned, hauling himself wearily to his feet. Anheg nodded. "They sent them up from
                down below while you were getting your exercise. You're not going to believe what's been going on back
                there."
            </p>
            <p>"Try me."</p>
            <p>"You absolutely won't believe it."</p>
            <p>"Anheg, spit it out."</p>
            <p>"We're about to get some reinforcements. Islena and Porenn have been very busy these last few weeks."</p>
            <p>Polgara looked at him sharply.</p>
            <p>"Do you know something?" Anheg said, holding out a folded dispatch. "I wasn't even aware of the fact that
                Islena knew how to read and write, and now I get this."
            </p>
            <p>"Don't be cryptic, Anheg," Polgara told him. "What have the ladies been up to?"</p>
            <p>"I gather that after we left, the Bear-cult began to make itself a bit obnoxious. Grodeg apparently felt
                that with the men out of the way, he could take over. He started throwing his weight around in Val
                Alorn, and cult members began to surface in the headquarters of Drasnian intelligence in Boktor. It
                looks as if they've been making preparations for something for years. Anyway, Porenn and Islena began
                passing information back and forth, and when they realized how close Grodeg was to getting his hands on
                real power in the two kingdoms, they took steps. Porenn ordered all the cult members out of Boktor -
                sent them to the most miserable duty posts she could think of - and Islena rounded up the Bear-cult in
                Val Alorn - every last one of them - and shipped them out to join the army."
            </p>
            <p>"They did what?" Rhodar gasped.</p>
            <p>"Isn't it amazing?" A slow grin spread across Anheg's coarse face. "The beauty of the whole thing is that
                Islena could get away with it, while I couldn't. Women aren't supposed to be aware of the subtleties
                involved in arresting priests and noblemen - the need for evidence against them and so on - so what
                would be gross impropriety on my part will be laughed off as ignorance on hers. I'll have to apologize
                to Grodeg, of course, but it will be after the fact. The cult will be here, and they'll have no honest
                reason to go back home."
            </p>
            <p>Rhodar's answering grin was every bit as wicked as Anheg's. "How did Grodeg take it?"</p>
            <p>"He was absolutely livid. I guess Islena faced him down personally. She gave him the choice of joining us
                or going to the dungeon."
            </p>
            <p>"You can't put the High Priest of Belar in a dungeon," Rhodar exclaimed.</p>
            <p>"Islena didn't know that, and Grodeg knew that she didn't. She'd have had him chained to the wall in the
                deepest hole she could find before anybody had gotten around to telling her that it was illegal. Can't
                you just see my Islena delivering that kind of ultimatum to the old windbag?" There was a note of fierce
                pride in Anheg's voice.
            </p>
            <p>King Rhodar's face grew very sly. "There's bound to be some rather hot fighting in this campaign sooner
                or later," he noted.
            </p>
            <p>Anheg nodded.</p>
            <p>"The Bear-cult prides itself on its fighting ability, doesn't it?" Anheg nodded again, grinning.</p>
            <p>"They'd be perfect for spearheading any attacks, wouldn't they?" Anheg's grin grew positively vicious.
            </p>
            <p>"I imagine that their casualties will be heavy," the King of Drasnia suggested.</p>
            <p>"It's in a good cause, after all," Anheg replied piously.</p>
            <p>"If you two have quite finished gloating, I think it's time I got the princess in out of the sun,"
                Polgara told the two grinning monarchs.
            </p>
            <p>The fortified positions atop the escarpment bustled with activity for the next several days. Even as the
                last of the Cherek ships were raised up the cliffs, the Algars and Mimbrates extended their depredations
                out into the Thullish countryside.
            </p>
            <p>"There aren't any crops standing for fifty leagues in any direction," Hettar reported back. "We'll have
                to go out farther to find anything else to burn."
            </p>
            <p>"You find many Murgos?" Barak asked the hawkfaced man.</p>
            <p>"A few." Hettar shrugged. "Not enough to make it interesting, but we run across one every now and
                then."
            </p>
            <p>"How's Mandorallen doing?"</p>
            <p>"I haven't seen him for a few days," Hettar replied. "There's a lot of smoke coming from the direction he
                went, though, so I imagine he's keeping busy."
            </p>
            <p>"What's the country like out there?" King Anheg asked.</p>
            <p>"Not bad, once you get past the uplands. The part of Thulldom along the escarpment here is pretty
                forbidding."
            </p>
            <p>"What do you mean by forbidding? I've got to haul ships through that country."</p>
            <p>"Rock, sand, a few thornbushes and no water," Hettar replied. "And it's hotter than the backdoor of a
                furnace."
            </p>
            <p>"Thanks," Anheg said.</p>
            <p>"You wanted to know," Hettar told him. "Excuse me. I need a fresh horse and some more torches."</p>
            <p>"You're going out again?" Barak asked him.</p>
            <p>"It's something to do."</p>
            <p>Once the last of the ships had been raised, the Drasnian hoists began lifting tons of food and equipment
                that soon swelled King Fulrach's supply dumps within the forts to overflowing. The Thullish prisoners
                proved to be an invaluable asset, carrying whatever burden they were told to carry without complaint or
                hesitation.
            </p>
            <p>Their coarse features shone with such simpleminded gratitude and eagerness to please that Ce'Nedra found
                it impossible to hate them, even though they were technically the enemy. Slowly, bit by bit, the
                princess discovered the facts that made the lives of the Thullish people such an unrelieved horror.
                There was not a family among them that had not lost several members to the knives of the Grolims -
                husbands, wives, children, and parents had all been selected for sacrifice, and the thought uppermost in
                every Thull's life was to avoid the same fate at any cost. The perpetual terror had erased every hint of
                human affection from the Thull's makeup. He lived in dreadful isolation, without love, without
                companionship, without any feeling but constant anxiety and dread. The reputedly insatiable appetite of
                Thullish women had nothing whatsoever to do with morals or lack of them. It was a simple matter of
                survival. To escape the knife, a Thullish woman was forced to remain perpetually pregnant. She was not
                driven by lust, but by fear, and her fear dehumanized her entirely.
            </p>
            <p>"How can they live that way?" the princess burst out to Lady Polgara as the two of them returned to their
                makeshift quarters in the stout blockhouse which had been erected inside the walls for the use of the
                leaders of the army. "Why don't they rebel and drive the Grolims out?"
            </p>
            <p>"And just who's supposed to lead a rebellion, Ce'Nedra?" Polgara asked her calmly. "The Thulls know that
                there are Grolims who can pick the thoughts from a man's mind as easily as you'd pick fruit in an
                orchard.
            </p>
            <p>If a Thull even considered organizing some kind of resistance, he'd be the next one dragged to the
                altar."
            </p>
            <p>"But their lives are so horrible, " Ce'Nedra objected.</p>
            <p>"Perhaps we can change that," Polgara said. "In a way what we're trying to do is not only for the benefit
                of the west, but for the Angaraks as well. If we win, they'll be liberated from the Grolims. They might
                not thank us at first, but in time they might learn to appreciate it."
            </p>
            <p>"Why shouldn't they thank us?"</p>
            <p>"Because if we win, dear, it will be because we've killed their God. That's a very hard thing to thank
                someone for."
            </p>
            <p>"But Torak is a monster."</p>
            <p>"He's still their God," Polgara replied. "The loss of one's God is a very subtle and terrible injury. Ask
                the Ulgos what it's like to live without one. It's been five thousand years since UL became their God,
                and they still remember what it was like before he accepted them."
            </p>
            <p>"We are going to win, aren't we?" Ce'Nedra asked suddenly, all her fears flooding to the surface.</p>
            <p>"I don't know, Ce'Nedra," Polgara answered quietly. "No one does - not me, not Beldin, not my father, not
                even Aldur. All we can do is try,"
            </p>
            <p>"What will happen if we lose?" the princess asked in a tiny, frightened voice.</p>
            <p>"We'll be enslaved in exactly the same way the Thulls are," Polgara replied quietly. "Torak will become
                King and God over the entire world. The other Gods will be banished forever, and the Grolims will be
                unleashed upon us all."
            </p>
            <p>"I won't live in that kind of world," Ce'Nedra declared.</p>
            <p>"None of us would care to."</p>
            <p>"Did you ever meet Torak?" the princess asked suddenly.</p>
            <p>Polgara nodded. "Once or twice - the last time was at Vo Mimbre just before his duel with Brand."</p>
            <p>"What's he really like?"</p>
            <p>"He's a God. The force of his mind is overwhelming. When he speaks to you, you must listen to him - and
                when he commands, you must obey him."
            </p>
            <p>"Not you, certainly."</p>
            <p>"I don't think you understand, dear." Polgara's face was grave, and her glorious eyes were as distant as
                the moon. Without seeming to think about it, she reached out, picked up Errand and sat him on her lap.
                The child smiled at her and, as he so often did, he reached out and touched the white lock at her brow.
                "There's a compulsion in Torak's voice that's almost impossible to resist," she continued. "You know
                that he's twisted and evil, but when he speaks to you, your will to resist crumbles, and you're suddenly
                very weak and afraid."
            </p>
            <p>"Surely you weren't afraid."</p>
            <p>"You still don't understand. Of course I was afraid. We all were - even my father. Pray that you never
                meet Torak. He's not some petty Grolim like Chamdar or a scheming old wizard like Ctuchik. He's a God.
                He's hideously maimed, and at some point he was thwarted. Something he needed - something so profound
                that no human could even conceive of it - was denied to him, and that refusal or rejection drove him
                mad. His madness is not like the madness of Taur Urgas, who, in spite of everything is still human.
                Torak's madness is the madness of a God - a being who can make his diseased imaginings come to pass.
                Only the Orb can truly withstand him. I could perhaps resist him for a time, but if he lays the full
                force of his will upon me, ultimately I'll have to give him what he wants - and what he wants from me is
                too dreadful to think about."
            </p>
            <p>"I don't exactly follow you, Lady Polgara."</p>
            <p>Garion's Aunt looked gravely at the tiny girl. "Perhaps you don't at that," she said. "It has to do with
                a part of the past that the Tolnedran Historical Society chooses to ignore. Sit down, Ce'Nedra, and I'll
                try to explain."
            </p>
            <p>The princess sat on a rude bench in their rough chamber. Polgara's mood was unusual - very quiet, even
                pensive. She placed her arms about Errand and held him close, nestling her cheek against his blond curls
                as if taking comfort from the contact with this small boy. "There are two Prophecies, Ce'Nedra," she
                explained in her rich voice, "but the time is coming when there will only be one. Everything that is or
                was or is yet to be will become a part of whichever Prophecy prevails. Every man, every woman, every
                child has two possible destinies. For some, the differences are not all that great, but in my case,
                they're rather profound."
            </p>
            <p>"I don't quite understand."</p>
            <p>"In the Prophecy which we serve - the one that has brought us here - I am Polgara the sorceress, daughter
                to Belgarath and guardian to Belgarion."
            </p>
            <p>"And in the other?"</p>
            <p>"In the other, I am the bride of Torak."</p>
            <p>Ce'Nedra gasped.</p>
            <p>"And now you see why I was afraid," Polgara continued. "I've been terrified of Torak since my father
                first explained this to me when I was no older than you are now. I'm not so much afraid for myself, but
                more because I know that if I falter - if Torak's will overpowers mine - then the Prophecy we serve will
                fail.
            </p>
            <p>Torak will not only win me, but all of mankind as well. At Vo Mimbre, he called to me, and I felt - very
                briefly - the awful compulsion to run to him. But I defied him. I've never done anything in my life that
                was so hard to do. It was my defiance, however, that drove him into the duel with Brand, and only in
                that duel could the power of the Orb be released against him. My father gambled everything on the
                strength of my will. The old wolf is a great gambler sometimes."
            </p>
            <p>"Then if-" Ce'Nedra could not say it.</p>
            <p>"If Garion loses?" Polgara said it so calmly that it was quite obvious that she had considered the
                possibility many times before. "Then Torak will come to claim his bride, and there will be no power on
                earth sufficient to stop him."
            </p>
            <p>"I would sooner die," the princess blurted.</p>
            <p>"So would I, Ce'Nedra, but that option may not be open to me. Torak's will is so much stronger than mine
                that he may be able to take from me the ability or even the desire to will myself out of existence. If
                it should happen, it may very well be that I'll be deliriously happy to be his chosen and beloved - but
                deep inside, I think that a part of me will be screaming and will continue to scream in horror down
                through all the endless centuries to the very end of days."
            </p>
            <p>It was too horrible to think about. Unable to restrain herself, the princess threw herself on her knees,
                clasped her arms about Polgara and Errand, and burst into tears.
            </p>
            <p>"Now, now, there's no need to cry, Ce'Nedra," Polgara told her gently, smoothing the sobbing girl's hair
                with her hand. "Garion has still not reached the City of Endless Night, and Torak is still asleep.
                There's a little time left. And who knows? We might even win."
            </p>

        <chapter number="13">
            <p>ONCE THE CHEREK fleet had been raised, the pace of activities within the fortifications began to quicken.
                King Rhodar's infantry units began to arrive from the encampment at the Aldur River to make the tortuous
                climb up the narrow ravines to the top of the escarpment; lines of wagons from the main supply dumps
                freighted food and equipment to the base of the cliff where the great hoists waited to lift the supplies
                up the mile-high basalt face; and the Mimbrate and Algar raiding parties moved out, usually before dawn,
                in their now far-flung search for as yet unravaged towns and crops. The depredations of the raiders,
                their short, savage sieges of poorly fortified Thullish towns and villages, and the mile-wide swaths of
                fire that they cut through fields of ripe grain had finally swung the sluggish Thulls into poorly
                organized attempts at resistance. The Thulls, however, inevitably raced to the last point of Mimbrate
                attack and arrived hours or even days too late, to discover only smoking ruins, dead soldiers, and
                terrified and dispossessed townsmen, or, when they attempted to intercept the swiftly moving Algars,
                they normally found only acre upon acre of blackened earth. The raiders had moved on, and the desperate
                attempts of the Thulls to catch up with them were entirely futile.
            </p>
            <p>The notion of attacking the forts from which the raiders operated did not occur to the Thulls, or if it
                did, it was quickly dismissed. The Thulls were not emotionally suited to attacking heavily defended
                fortifications.
            </p>
            <p>They much preferred dashing about, chasing fires, and complaining bitterly to their Murgo and Mallorean
                allies about the lack of support they were receiving. The Malloreans of Emperor 'Zakath steadfastly
                refused to emerge from their staging areas around Thull Zelik. The Murgos of Taur Urgas, however, did
                make a few sorties in southern Thulldom, in part as a gesture toward the notion of Angarak unity - but
                more, King Rhodar surmised, as a part of their overall maneuvering for position. Murgo scouts were even
                occasionally discovered in the vicinity of the forts themselves. In order to sweep the area clear of
                these prying Murgo eyes, patrols went out every day from the forts to range through the arid hills. The
                parched, rocky valleys near the forts were randomly searched by Drasnian pikemen and platoons of
                legionnaires. Algar clansmen, supposedly resting from their long-range raids, amused themselves with an
                impromptu game they called "Murgo hunting." They made a great show of their frequent excursions and
                piously insisted that they were sacrificing their rest time out of a sense of responsibility for the
                security of the forts. They did not, of course, fool anybody with their protestations.
            </p>
            <p>"The area does need to be patrolled, Rhodar," King Cho-Hag insisted. "My children are performing a
                necessary duty, after all."
            </p>
            <p>"Duty?" Rhodar snorted. "Put an Algar on a horse and show him a hill he hasn't seen the backside of yet,
                and he'll always find an excuse to go take a look."
            </p>
            <p>"You wrong us," Cho-Hag replied with a look of hurt innocence.</p>
            <p>"I know you."</p>
            <p>Ce'Nedra and her two closest companions had watched the periodic departure of the lighthearted Algar
                horsemen with increasingly sour expressions. Though Ariana was perhaps more sedentary in her habits and
                was accustomed, as all Mimbrate ladies were, to waiting quite patiently while the men were out playing,
                Adara, Garion's Algar cousin, felt her confinement most keenly. Like all Algars, she felt a deep-seated
                need to have the wind in her face and the thunder of hoofs in her ears. She grew petulant after a time
                and sighed often.
            </p>
            <p>"And what shall we do today, ladies?" Ce'Nedra asked the two of them brightly one morning after
                breakfast. "How shall we amuse ourselves until lunchtime?" She said it rather extravagantly, since she
                already had plans for the day.
            </p>
            <p>"There is always embroidery," Ariana suggested. "It doth pleasantly occupy the fingers and eyes while
                leaving the mind and lips free for conversation."
            </p>
            <p>Adara sighed deeply.</p>
            <p>"Or maybe we might go and observe my lord as he instructs his serfs in their warlike preparations."
                Ariana usually found some excuse to watch Lelldorin for at least half of each day.
            </p>
            <p>"I'm not sure that I'm up to watching a group of men murder hay bales with arrows again today," Adara
                said a bit waspishly.
            </p>
            <p>Ce'Nedra moved quickly to head off any incipient bickering. "We could make an inspection tour," she
                suggested archly.
            </p>
            <p>"Ce'Nedra, we've looked at every blockhouse and every hut within the walls a dozen times already," Adara
                said with some asperity, "and if I have some polite old sergeant explain the workings of a catapult to
                me one more time, I think I'll scream."
            </p>
            <p>"We have not, however, inspected the outer fortifications, have we?" the princess asked slyly. "Wouldn't
                you say that's part of our duty too?"
            </p>
            <p>Adara looked at her quickly, and then a slow smile appeared on her face. "Absolutely," she agreed. "I'm
                surprised that we hadn't thought of that before. We've been most neglectful, haven't we?"
            </p>
            <p>Ariana's face took on a worned frown. "King Rhodar, I fear, would be most strenuous in his objections to
                such a plan."
            </p>
            <p>"Rhodar isn't here," Ce'Nedra pointed out. "He's off with King Fulrach taking an inventory of the supply
                dumps."
            </p>
            <p>"Lady Polgara would most certainly not approve," Ariana suggested, though her tone indicated that she was
                weakening.
            </p>
            <p>"Lady Polgara is conferring with Beldin the sorcerer," Adara mentioned, her eyes dancing mischievously.
            </p>
            <p>Ce'Nedra smirked. "That rather leaves us to our own devices, doesn't it, ladies?"</p>
            <p>"We shall be soundly scolded upon our return," Ariana said. "And we will all be very contrite, won't
                we?"
            </p>
            <p>Ce'Nedra giggled.</p>
            <p>A quarter of an hour later, the princess and her two friends, dressed in soft black leather Algar riding
                clothes, passed at a canter out through the central gate of the vast fort. They were accompanied by
                Olban, the youngest son of the Rivan Warder. Olban had not liked the idea, but Ce'Nedra had given him no
                time to object and definitely no time to send a message to anyone who could step in and stop the whole
                excursion.
            </p>
            <p>Olban looked worried, but, as always, he accompanied the little Rivan Queen without question.</p>
            <p>The stake-studded trenches in front of the walls were very interesting, but one trench looked much like
                another, and it took a rare mind indeed to find much pleasure in the finer points of excavation.
            </p>
            <p>"Very nice," Ce'Nedra said brightly to a Drasnian pikeman standing guard atop a high mound of dirt.</p>
            <p>"Splendid ditches - and all those excellently sharp stakes." She looked out at the arid landscape before
                the fortifications. "Where did you ever find all the wood for them?"
            </p>
            <p>"The Sendars brought it in, your Majesty," he replied, "from someplace up north, I think. We had the
                Thulls cut and sharpen the stakes for us. They're quite good stake-makers - if you tell them what you
                want."
            </p>
            <p>"Didn't a mounted patrol go out this way about a half an hour ago?" Ce'Nedra asked him.</p>
            <p>"Yes, your Majesty. Lord Hettar of Algaria and some of his men. They went off that way." The guard
                pointed toward the south.
            </p>
            <p>"Ah," Ce'Nedra said. "If anyone should ask, tell them that we're going out to join him. We should return
                in a few hours."
            </p>
            <p>The guard looked a bit dubious about that, but Ce'Nedra moved quickly to head off any objections. "Lord
                Hettar promised to wait for us just beyond the south end of the fortifications," she told him. She
                turned to her companions. "We really mustn't keep him waiting too long. You ladies took absolutely too
                much time changing clothes." She smiled winsomely at the guard. "You know how it is," she said. "The
                riding habit must be just so, and the hair absolutely has to be brushed one last time. Sometimes it
                takes forever. Come along, ladies. We must hurry, or Lord Hettar will be vexed with us." With a
                brainless little giggle, the princess wheeled Noble and rode south at a gallop.
            </p>
            <p>"Ce'Nedra, "Ariana exclaimed in a shocked voice once they were out of earshot, "you lied to him."</p>
            <p>"Of course."</p>
            <p>"But that's dreadful."</p>
            <p>"Not nearly as dreadful as spending another day embroidering daisies on a stupid petticoat," the princess
                replied.
            </p>
            <p>They left the fortifications and crossed a low, burned-brown string of hills. The broad valley beyond was
                enormous. Dun brown and treeless mountains reared up fully twenty miles away at the valley's far end.
            </p>
            <p>They cantered down into that vast emptiness, feeling dwarfed into insignificance by the colossal
                landscape.
            </p>
            <p>Their horses seemed no more than ants crawling toward the indifferent mountains.</p>
            <p>"I hadn't realized it was so big," Ce'Nedra murmured, shading her eyes to gaze at the distant hilltops.
            </p>
            <p>The floor of the valley was as flat as a tabletop, and it was only sparsely sprinkled with low, thorny
                bushes.
            </p>
            <p>The ground was scattered with round, fist-sized rocks, and the dust spurted, yellow and powdery, from
                each step of their horses' hoofs. Although it was scarcely midmorning, the sun was already a furnace,
                and shimmering heatwaves rippled the valley floor ahead, making the dusty, gray-green bushes seem to
                dance in the windless air.
            </p>
            <p>It grew hotter. There was no trace of moisture anywhere, and the sweat dried almost instantly on the
                flanks of their panting horses.
            </p>
            <p>"I think we should give some thought to going back," Adara said, reining in her mount. "There's no way we
                can reach those hills at the end of the valley."
            </p>
            <p>"She's right, your Majesty," Olban told the princess. "We've already come too far."</p>
            <p>Ce'Nedra pulled Noble to a stop, and the white horse drooped his head as if on the verge of absolute
                exhaustion. "Oh, quit feeling sorry for yourself," she chided him irritably. This was not going at all
                as she had expected. She looked around. "I wonder if we could find some shade somewhere," she said. Her
                lips were dry, and the sun seemed to hammer down on her unprotected head.
            </p>
            <p>"The terrain doth not suggest such comfort, princess," Ariana said, looking around at the flat emptiness
                of the rock-strewn valley floor.
            </p>
            <p>"Did anyone think to bring any water?" Ce'Nedra asked, dabbing at her forehead with a kerchief.</p>
            <p>No one had.</p>
            <p>"Maybe we should go back," she decided, looking about rather regretfully. "There's nothing to see out
                here, anyway."
            </p>
            <p>"Riders coming," Adara said sharply, pointing toward a mounted group of men emerging from an indented
                galley that lay like a fold on the flanks of a rounded hill a mile or so away.
            </p>
            <p>"Murgos?" Olban demanded with a sharp intake of his breath. His hand went immediately to his sword.</p>
            <p>Adara raised her hand to shade her eyes and stared at the approaching horsemen intently.</p>
            <p>"No," she replied. "They're Algars. I can tell by the way they ride."</p>
            <p>"I hope they have some water with them," Ce'Nedra said.</p>
            <p>The dozen or so Algar riders rode directly toward them with a great cloud of yellow dust rising behind
                them. Adara suddenly gasped, and her face went very pale.
            </p>
            <p>"What is it?" Ce'Nedra asked her.</p>
            <p>"Lord Hettar is with them," Adara said in a choked voice.</p>
            <p>"How can you possibly recognize anybody at that distance?"</p>
            <p>Adara bit her lip, but did not reply.</p>
            <p>Hettar's face was fierce and unforgiving as he reined in his sweating horse. "What are you doing out
                here?"
            </p>
            <p>he demanded bluntly. His hawkface and black scalp lock gave him a wild, even frightening appearance.</p>
            <p>"We thought we'd go riding, Lord Hettar," Ce'Nedra replied brightly, trying to outface him.</p>
            <p>Hettar ignored that. "Have you lost your mind, Olban?" he harshly asked the young Rivan. "Why did you
                permit the ladies to leave the forts?"
            </p>
            <p>"I do not tell her Majesty what to do," Olban answered stiffly, his face red.</p>
            <p>"Oh, come now, Hettar," Ce'Nedra protested. "What's the harm in our taking a little ride?"</p>
            <p>"We killed three Murgos not a mile from here just yesterday," Hettar told her. "If you want exercise, run
                around the inside of the forts for a few hours. Don't just ride out unprotected in hostile territory.
                You've acted very foolishly, Ce'Nedra. We'll go back now." His face was grim as a winter sea, and his
                tone left no room for discussion.
            </p>
            <p>"We had just made the same decision, my Lord," Adara murmured, her eyes downcast.</p>
            <p>Hettar looked sternly at the condition of their horses. "You're an Algar, Lady Adara," he said
                pointedly.
            </p>
            <p>"Didn't it occur to you to bring water for your mounts? Surely you know better than to take a horse out
                in this kind of heat without any precautions at all."
            </p>
            <p>Adara's pale face grew stricken.</p>
            <p>Hettar shook his head in disgust. "Water their horses," he curtly told one of his men, "and then we'll
                escort them back. Your excursion is over, ladies."
            </p>
            <p>Adara's face was flaming with a look of almost unbearable shame. She twisted this way and that in her
                saddle, trying to avoid Hettar's stern, unforgiving stare. No sooner had her horse been watered than she
                jerked her reins and dug her heels into his flanks. Her startled mount scrambled his hoofs in the gravel
                and leaped away, running back the way they had come across the rock-littered valley floor.
            </p>
            <p>Hettar swore and drove his mount after her.</p>
            <p>"Whatever is she doing?" Ce'Nedra exclaimed.</p>
            <p>"Lord Hettar's rebuke hath stung our gentle companion beyond her endurance," Ariana observed. "His good
                opinion is dearer to her than leer life itself."
            </p>
            <p>"Hettar?" Ce'Nedra was stunned.</p>
            <p>"Hath not throe eye informed thee how it doth stand with our dear friend?" Ariana asked in mild
                surprise.
            </p>
            <p>"Thou art strangely unobservant, Princess."</p>
            <p>"Hettar?" Ce'Nedra repeated. "I had no idea."</p>
            <p>"Mayhap it is because I am Mimbrate," Ariana concluded. "The ladies of my people are most sensitive to
                the signs of gentle affection in others."
            </p>
            <p>It took perhaps a hundred yards for Hettar to overtake Adara's plunging horse. He seized her reins in one
                fist and jerked her roughly to a stop, speaking sharply to her, demanding to know what she was doing.
            </p>
            <p>Adara twisted this way and that in her saddle, trying to keep him from seeing her face as he continued to
                chide her.
            </p>
            <p>Then a flicker of movement no more than twenty feet from the two of them caught Ce'Nedra's eye.</p>
            <p>Astonishingly, a mail-shined Murgo rose up out of the sand between two scrubby bushes, shaking off the
                sheet of brown-splotched canvas beneath which he had lain concealed. As he rose, his short bow was
                already drawn.
            </p>
            <p>"Hettar!" Ce'Nedra screamed as the Murgo raised his bow. Hettar's back was to the Murgo, but Adara saw
                the man aiming his arrow at the Algar's unprotected back. With a desperate move, she ripped her reins
                from Hettar's grip and drove her horse into his. His mount lurched back, stumbled and fell, throwing the
                unprepared man to the ground even as Adara, flailing her horse's flanks with the ends of her reins,
                plunged directly at the Murgo.
            </p>
            <p>With only the faintest flicker of annoyance, the Murgo released his arrow at the charging girl.</p>
            <p>Even at that distance, Ce'Nedra could hear the distinct sound the arrow made when it struck Adara. It was
                a sound she would remember with horror for the remainder of her life. Adara doubled sharply, her free
                hand clutching at the arrow buried low in her chest, but her plunging gallop did not falter nor change
                as she rode the Murgo down. He tumbled and rolled beneath the churning hoofs of her horse, then lurched
                again to his

            </p>
            <p>feet as soon as she had passed over him, his hand jerking at his sheathed sword. But Hettar was already
                upon him, sabre flashing in the glaring sunlight. The Murgo screamed once as he fell.
            </p>
            <p>Hettar, his dripping sabre still in his hand, turned angrily to Adara. "What a stupid thing," he roared
                at her, but his shout cut off suddenly. Her horse had come to a stop a few yards beyond the Murgo, and
                she drooped in her saddle, her dark hair falling like a veil across her pale face and both of her hands
                pressed to her chest. Then, slowly, she toppled from her saddle.
            </p>
            <p>With a strangled cry, Hettar dropped his sabre and ran to her.</p>
            <p>"Adara!" the princess wailed, her hands going to her face in horror even as Hettar gently turned the
                stricken girl over. The arrow, still standing out of her lower chest, throbbed with the rhythm of her
                faltering heartbeat.
            </p>
            <p>When the rest of them reached the pair, Hettar was holding Adara in his arms, staring into her pale face
                with a stricken look. "You little fool," he was murmuring in a broken voice. "You little fool."
            </p>
            <p>Ariana slid from her saddle even before her horse stopped moving and ran to Hettar's side. "Do not move
                her, my Lord," she told him sharply. "The arrow hath pierced her lung, and shouldst thou move her, its
                keen edge will gash out her life."
            </p>
            <p>"Take it out," Hettar said from between clenched teeth.</p>
            <p>"Nay, my Lord. To pull the arrow now will do more damage than to leave it."</p>
            <p>"I can't bear to see it sticking out of her like that," he almost sobbed.</p>
            <p>"Then don't look, my Lord," Ariana said bluntly, kneeling beside Adara and placing a cool, professional
                hand on the wounded girl's throat.
            </p>
            <p>"She's not dead, is she?" Hettar almost begged.</p>
            <p>Ariana shook her head. "Gravely wounded, but her life doth still pulse within her. Instruct thy men to
                improvise a litter at once, my Lord. We must convey our dear friend to the fortress and Lady Polgara's
                ministrations immediately, lest her life drain away."
            </p>
            <p>"Can't you do something?" he croaked.</p>
            <p>"Not here in this sun-blasted desolation, my Lord. I have neither instruments nor medications, and the
                wound may be past my skill. The Lady Polgara is her only hope. The litter, my Lord. Quickly!"
            </p>
            <p>Polgara's face was somber, and her eyes as hard as flint when she emerged from Adara's sickroom late that
                afternoon.
            </p>
            <p>"How is she?" Hettar demanded. He had been pacing up and down in the main corridor of the blockhouse for
                hours, stopping every so often to strike savagely at the crudely built stone walls with his impotent
                fists.
            </p>
            <p>"Somewhat improved," Polgara replied. "The crisis is past, but she's still terribly weak. She's asking
                for you."
            </p>
            <p>"She will recover, won't she?" Hettar's question had a note of fear in it.</p>
            <p>"Probably - if there aren't any complications. She's young, and the wound looked more serious than it
                actually was. I gave her something that will make her very talkative, but don't stay too long. She needs
                rest." Polgara's eyes moved to Ce'Nedra's tearstreaked face. "Come to my room after you've seen her,
                your Majesty," she said firmly. "You and I have something to discuss."
            </p>
            <p>Adara's porcelain face was framed by the tumbled mass of her dark brown hair spreading across the
                pillow.
            </p>
            <p>She was very pale, but, though her eyes had a slightly unfocused look about them, they were very
                bright.
            </p>
            <p>Ariana sat quietly at the bedside.</p>
            <p>"How do you feel, Adara?" Ce'Nedra asked in the quiet but cheerful voice one always assumes with the
                sick.
            </p>
            <p>Adara gave her a wan little smile.</p>
            <p>"Are you in any pain?"</p>
            <p>"No," Adara's voice had a little dying fall to it. "No pain, but I feel very light-headed and strange."
            </p>
            <p>"Why did you do that, Adara?" Hettar asked very directly. "You didn't have to ride right at the Murgo
                like that."
            </p>
            <p>"You spend too much time with horses, my Lord Sha-dar," Adara told him with a faint smile. "You've
                forgotten how to understand the feelings of your own kind."
            </p>
            <p>"What's that supposed to mean?" He sounded puzzled.</p>
            <p>"Exactly what it says, my Lord Hettar. If a mare looked admiringly at a stallion, you'd know how things
                stood immediately, wouldn't you? But when it comes to people, you simply can't see at all, can you?" She
                coughed weakly.
            </p>
            <p>"Are you all right?" he asked sharply.</p>
            <p>"I'm surprisingly well - considering the fact that I'm dying."</p>
            <p>"What are you talking about? You're not dying."</p>
            <p>She smiled slightly. "Please don't," she told him. "I know what an arrow in the chest means. That's why I
                wanted to see you. I wanted to look at your face once more. I've been watching your face for such a long
                time now."
            </p>
            <p>"You're tired," he said brusquely. "You'll feel better after you've slept."</p>
            <p>"I'll sleep, all right," she said ruefully, "but I doubt that I'll feel anything afterward. The sleep I'm
                going to is the sleep one doesn't wake up from."
            </p>
            <p>"Nonsense."</p>
            <p>"Of course it is, but it's true nonetheless." She sighed. "Well, dear Hettar, you've finally escaped me,
                haven't you? I gave you a good chase, though. I even asked Garion to see if he could use sorcery on
                you."
            </p>
            <p>"Garion?"</p>
            <p>She nodded slightly. "You see how desperate I was? He said he couldn't, though." She made a little
                face.
            </p>
            <p>"What good is sorcery if you can't use it to make someone fall in love?"</p>
            <p>"Love?" he repeated in a startled voice.</p>
            <p>"What did you think we were talking about, Lord Hettar? The weather?" She smiled fondly at him.</p>
            <p>"Sometimes you can be impossibly dense."</p>
            <p>He stared at her in amazement.</p>
            <p>"Don't be alarmed, my Lord. In a little while, I'll stop chasing you, and you'll be free."</p>
            <p>"We'll talk about that when you're better," he told her gravely.</p>
            <p>"I'm not going to get better. Haven't you been listening? I'm dying, Hettar."</p>
            <p>"No," he said, "as a matter of fact, you're not dying. Polgara assured us that you're going to be all
                right."
            </p>
            <p>Adara looked quickly at Ariana. "Throe injury is not mortal, dear friend," Ariana confirmed gently.
                "Truly, thou art not dying."
            </p>
            <p>Adara closed her eyes. "How inconvenient," she murmured, a faint blush coming to her cheeks. She opened
                her eyes again. "I apologize, Hettar. I wouldn't have said any of this if I'd known that my meddling
                physicians were going to save my life. As soon as I'm up and about, I'll return to my own clan. I won't
                bother you again with my foolish outbursts."
            </p>
            <p>Hettar looked down at her, his hard-angled face expressionless. "I don't think I'd like that," he told
                her, gently taking her hand. "There are things you and I need to talk about. This isn't the time or the
                place, but don't go trying to make yourself unaccessible."
            </p>
            <p>"You're just being kind." She sighed.</p>
            <p>"No. Practical. You've given me something to think about beside killing Murgos. It's probably going to
                take me a while to get used to the idea, but after I've thought it over, we'll definitely need to talk."
            </p>
            <p>She bit her lip and tried to hide her face. "What a stupid mess I've made of things," she said. "If I
                were somebody else, I'd laugh at me. It would really be better if we didn't see each other again."
            </p>
            <p>"No," he said firmly, still holding her hand, "it wouldn't. And don't try to hide from me, because I'll
                find you - even if I have to have every horse in Algaria go looking for you."
            </p>
            <p>She gave him a startled look.</p>
            <p>"I am a Sha-dar, remember? Horses do what I tell them to."</p>
            <p>"That's not fair," she objected.</p>
            <p>He gave her a quizzical little smile. "And trying to have Garion use sorcery on me was?" he asked her.
            </p>
            <p>"Oh, dear!" She blushed.</p>
            <p>"She must rest now," Ariana told them. "Thou canst speak with her further on the morrow."</p>
            <p>When they were back out in the hallway, Ce'Nedra turned on the tall man. "You might have said something a
                bit more encouraging," she scolded him.
            </p>
            <p>"It would have been premature," he replied. "We're a rather reserved people, Princess. We don't say
                things just to be talking. Adara understands the situation." Hettar seemed as fierce as ever, his
                sharp-angled face hard, and his manelike scalp lock flowing over one leather-armored shoulder. His eyes,
                however, had softened slightly, and there was a faintly puzzled crease between his brows. "Didn't
                Polgara want to see you?" he asked. It was polite, but it was a dismissal nonetheless.
            </p>
            <p>Ce'Nedra stalked away, muttering to herself about the lack of consideration that seemed to infect the
                male half of the population.
            </p>
            <p>Lady Polgara sat quietly in her room, waiting. "Well?" she said when the princess entered. "Would you
                care to explain?"
            </p>
            <p>"Explain what?"</p>
            <p>"The reason for the idiocy that almost cost Adara her life."</p>
            <p>"Surely you don't think it was my fault," Ce'Nedra protested.</p>
            <p>"Whose fault was it, then? What were you doing out there?"</p>
            <p>"We just went for a little ride. It's so boring being cooped up all the time."</p>
            <p>"Boring. What a fascinating reason to kill your friends."</p>
            <p>Ce'Nedra gaped at her, her face suddenly very pale.</p>
            <p>"Why do you think we built these fortifications to begin with, Ce'Nedra? It was to provide us with some
                measure of protection."
            </p>
            <p>"I didn't know there were Murgos out there," the princess wailed.</p>
            <p>"Did you bother to find out?"</p>
            <p>The entire implication of what she had done quite suddenly came crashing in on Ce'Nedra. She began to
                tremble violently, and her shaking hand went to her mouth. It was her fault! No matter how she might
                twist and turn and try to evade the responsibility, her foolishness had nearly killed one of her dearest
                friends.
            </p>
            <p>Adara had almost paid with her life for a bit of childish thoughtlessness. Ce'Nedra buried her face in
                her hands in a sudden storm of weeping.
            </p>
            <p>Polgara let her cry for several moments, giving her ample time to accept her guilt; and when she finally
                spoke, there was no hint of forgiveness in her voice. "Tears won't wash out blood, Ce'Nedra," she said.
                "I thought I could at least begin to trust your judgment, but it appears that I was wrong. You may leave
                now. I don't believe I have anything more to say to you this evening."
            </p>
            <p>Sobbing, the princess fled.</p>
        </chapter>
        <chapter number="14">
            <p>"IS THIS PLACE all like this?" King Anheg asked as the army trudged through one of the flat,
                gravel-strewn valleys with the bare, sun-baked mountains around it dancing in the shimmering heat. "I
                haven't seen a tree since we left the forts."
            </p>
            <p>"The country changes about twenty leagues out, your Majesty," Hettar replied quietly, lounging in his
                saddle as they rode in the blazing sunlight. "We start to hit trees when we begin coming down out of the
                uplands. They're a kind of low, scraggly spruce, but they break up the monotony a bit."
            </p>
            <p>The column behind them stretched out for miles, dwarfed into a thin line by the enormous emptiness and
                marked more by the cloud of yellow dust raised by thousands of feet than by the presence of men and
                horses. The Cherek ships, covered with canvas, jolted along over the rocky ground on their low, wheeled
                cradles, and the dust hung over them in the stifling heat like a gritty blanket.
            </p>
            <p>"I'd pay a lot for a breeze right now," Anheg said wistfully, wiping his face.</p>
            <p>"Just leave things the way they are, Anheg," Barak advised him. "It wouldn't take much to start a dust
                storm."
            </p>
            <p>"How much farther is it to the river?" King Rhodar asked plaintively, looking at the unchanging
                landscape.
            </p>
            <p>The heat was having a brutal effect on the corpulent monarch. His face was beet red, and he was soaked
                and dripping with sweat.
            </p>
            <p>"Still about forty leagues," Hettar replied.</p>
            <p>General Varana, mounted on a roan stallion, cantered back from the vanguard of the column. The general
                wore a short leather kilt and a plain breastplate and helmet bearing no marks of his rank. "The Mimbrate
                knights just flushed out another pocket of Murgos," he reported.
            </p>
            <p>"How many?" King Rhodar asked.</p>
            <p>"Twenty or so. Three or four got away, but the Algars are chasing them."</p>
            <p>"Shouldn't our patrols be farther out?" King Anheg fretted, mopping his face again. "Those ships don't
                look that much like wagons. I'd rather not have to fight my way down the River Mardu-if we ever get
                there."
            </p>
            <p>"I've got people moving around out there, Anheg," King Cho-Hag assured him.</p>
            <p>"Has anyone run across any Malloreans yet?" Anheg asked.</p>
            <p>"Not so far," Cho-Hag replied. "All we've seen so far are Thulls and Murgos."</p>
            <p>"It looks as if 'Zakath is holding firm at Thull Zelik," Varana added.</p>
            <p>"I wish I knew more about him," Rhodar said.</p>
            <p>"The Emperor's emissaries report that he's a very civilized man," Varana said. "Cultured, urbane, very
                polite."
            </p>
            <p>"I'm sure there's another side to him," Rhodar disagreed. "The Nadraks are terrified of him, and it takes
                a lot to frighten a Nadrak."
            </p>
            <p>"As long as he stays at Thull Zelik, I don't care what kind of man he is," Anheg declared.</p>
            <p>Colonel Brendig rode forward from the toiling column of infantry and wagons stretched out behind them.
            </p>
            <p>"King Fulrach asks that we halt the column for a rest period," he reported.</p>
            <p>"Again?" Anheg demanded irritably.</p>
            <p>"We've marched for two hours, your Majesty," Brendig pointed out. "Marching in all this heat and dust is
                very exhausting for infantry. The men won't be much good in a fight if they're all wrung out from
                walking."
            </p>
            <p>"Halt the column, Colonel," Polgara told the Sendarian baronet. "We can rely on Fulrach's judgment in
                these matters." She turned to the King of Cherek. "Stop being so peevish, Anheg," she chided him.
            </p>
            <p>"I'm being broiled alive, Polgara," he complained.</p>
            <p>"Try walking for a few miles," she told him sweetly. "That may give you some insight into how the
                infantry feels "
            </p>
            <p>Anheg scowled, but remained silent.</p>
            <p>Princess Ce'Nedra pulled in her sweating mount as the column halted. The princess had spoken very little
                since Adara had been wounded. The dreadful sense of her responsibility for her friend's nearly fatal
                injury had sobered her enormously, and she had retreated into a kind of shell that was totally unnatural
                for her.
            </p>
            <p>She removed the loosewoven straw hat that a captive Thull had made for her back at the fort and squinted
                at the blistering sky.
            </p>
            <p>"Put the hat back on, Ce'Nedra," Lady Polgara told her. "I don't want you getting sunstroke."</p>
            <p>Ce'Nedra obediently put her hat back on. "He's coming back," she reported, pointing at a speck in the sky
                high above them.
            </p>
            <p>"Will you excuse me?" General Varana said, turning his horse to leave.</p>
            <p>"You're being absurd, Varana," King Rhodar told the Tolnedran. "Why do you insist on refusing to admit he
                can do things you don't want to believe in?"
            </p>
            <p>"It's a matter of principle, your Majesty," the general replied. "Tolnedrans do not believe in sorcery. I
                am a Tolnedran, therefore I do not admit that it exists." He hesitated. "I must concede, however, that
                his information is surprisingly accurate - however he gets it."
            </p>
            <p>A large, blue-banded hawk fell suddenly out of the broiling air like a stone, flared his wings at the
                last moment, and settled on the ground directly in front of them.
            </p>
            <p>General Varana resolutely turned his back and stared with apparently deep interest at a featureless hill
                some five miles distant.
            </p>
            <p>The hawk began to shimmer and change even as he folded his wings. "Are you stopping again?" Beldin
                demanded irascibly.
            </p>
            <p>"We have to rest the troops, Uncle," Polgara replied.</p>
            <p>"This isn't a Sunday stroll, Pol," Beldin retorted. He began to scratch one armpit, befouling the air
                around him with a string of rancid curses.
            </p>
            <p>"What's the matter?" Polgara asked mildly.</p>
            <p>"Lice," he grunted.</p>
            <p>"How did he get lice?"</p>
            <p>"I visited some other birds to ask if they'd seen anything. I think I picked them up in a vulture's
                nest."
            </p>
            <p>"What could possibly possess you to go consorting with vultures?"</p>
            <p>"Vultures aren't that bad, Pol. They perform a necessary function, and the chicks do have a certain
                charm.
            </p>
            <p>The she-vulture had been picking at a dead horse about twenty leagues south of here. After she told me
                about it, I went down to take a look. There's a Murgo column coming this way."
            </p>
            <p>"How many?" General Varana asked quickly, his back still turned to them.</p>
            <p>"A thousand or so," Beldin shrugged. "They're pushing hard. They'll probably intercept you tomorrow
                morning."
            </p>
            <p>"A thousand Murgos aren't that much to worry about," King Rhodar said, frowning. "Not to an army of this
                size. But what's the point of throwing a thousand men away? What does Taur Urgas hope to accomplish?"
            </p>
            <p>He turned to Hettar. "Do you suppose you could ride ahead and ask Korodullin and the Baron of Vo Mandor
                to join us. I think we ought to have a conference."
            </p>
            <p>Hettar nodded and loped his horse ahead toward the gleaming ranks of the Mimbrate knights at the head of
                the column.
            </p>
            <p>"Were there any Grolims with the Murgos, Uncle?" Polgara asked the filthy hunchback.</p>
            <p>"Not unless they were well-hidden," he replied. "I didn't probe too much, though. I didn't want to give
                myself away."
            </p>
            <p>General Varana abruptly abandoned his careful study of the hills around them and turned his horse about
                to join them. "My first guess would be that the Murgo column is a token gesture from Taur Urgas. He
                probably wants to get on the good side of King Gethell; and since the Malloreans won't leave Thull
                Zelik, he can pick up some advantage by committing a few troops to aid in the defense of the Thullish
                towns and villages we've been destroying."
            </p>
            <p>"That makes sense, Rhodar," Anheg agreed.</p>
            <p>"Maybe," Rhodar said dubiously. "Taur Urgas doesn't think like a rational man, though."</p>
            <p>King Korodullin, flanked by Mandorallen and the Baron of Vo Ebor, thundered back to join them. Their
                armor flashed in the sun, and all three were flushed and miserable-looking in their steel casings.
            </p>
            <p>"How can you stand all that?" Rhodar asked.</p>
            <p>"Custom, your Majesty," Korodullin replied. "The armor doth inflict some discomfort, but we have learned
                to endure it."
            </p>
            <p>General Varana quickly sketched in the situation for them. Mandorallen shrugged. "It is of no moment. I
                will take some few dozen men and smash this threat from the south."
            </p>
            <p>Barak looked at King Anheg. "You see what I mean about him?" he said. "Now you can understand why I was
                so nervous all the time we were chasing across Cthol Murgos."
            </p>
            <p>King Fulrach had ridden forward to join the conference, and he cleared his throat diffidently. "Might I
                make a suggestion?" he asked.
            </p>
            <p>"We eagerly await the practical wisdom of the King of the Sendars," Korodullin replied with extravagant
                courtesy.
            </p>
            <p>"The Murgo column doesn't really pose much of a threat, does it?" Fulrach inquired.</p>
            <p>"Not really, your Majesty," Varana replied. "At least, now that we know that they're out there. We think
                that they're some kind of minor relief column sent to placate the Thulls. Their presence in our vicinity
                is probably entirely accidental."
            </p>
            <p>"I don't want them getting close enough to recognize my ships, though," Anheg declared firmly.</p>
            <p>"We'll take care of that, Anheg," Rhodar told him.</p>
            <p>"Any one of the elements of our army might easily overcome so slight a threat," Fulrach continued, "but
                mightn't it be better - from a morale standpoint - to give the victory to the entire army?"
            </p>
            <p>"I don't quite follow you, Fulrach," Anheg said.</p>
            <p>"Instead of letting Sir Mandorallen annihilate these thousand Murgos all by himself, why not select a
                contingent from each part of the army to deal with them? Not only will that give us some experience in
                tactical coordination, but it'll give all the men a sense of pride. An easy victory now will stiffen
                their backs when we run into more difficult times later."
            </p>
            <p>"Fulrach, sometimes you positively amaze me," Rhodar declared. "I think the whole trouble is that you
                don't look that clever."
            </p>
            <p>The contingents that were to turn south to meet the approaching Murgos were selected by lot, once again
                at the suggestion of King Fulrach. "That way there'll be no suspicion in the army that this is some kind
                of elite force," he noted.
            </p>
            <p>While the rest of the column pushed on toward the headwaters of the River Mardu, the miniature army under
                the command of Barak, Hettar, and Mandorallen veered to the south to intercept the enemy spearhead.
            </p>
            <p>"They'll be all right, won't they?" Ce'Nedra nervously asked Polgara as she watched them growing smaller
                and smaller as they rode off across the arid valley toward the solid line of mountains to the south.
            </p>
            <p>"I'm certain they will, dear," Polgara replied confidently.</p>
            <p>The princess, however, did not sleep that night. For the first time, members of her army were committed
                to a real battle, and she tossed and turned the entire night, imagining all manner of disasters.
            </p>
            <p>About midmorning of the following day, however, the special force returned. There were a few bandages
                here and there and perhaps a dozen empty saddles, but the look of victory shone on every face.
            </p>
            <p>"Very nice little fight," Barak reported. The huge man was grinning broadly. "We caught them just before
                sundown. They never knew what hit them."
            </p>
            <p>General Varana, who had accompanied the force to observe, was a bit more precise as he described the
                engagement to the assembled kings.
            </p>
            <p>"The general tactics did work pretty much as we'd planned," he said. "The Asturian archers swept the
                column with an arrow storm to begin with, and then the infantry units moved into position at the top of
                a long slope. We interspersed legionnaires, Drasnian pikemen, Sendars and the Arendish serf units evenly
                along the entire front with the archers behind them to continue harassing the enemy with arrows. As we
                expected, the Murgos charged. As soon as they'd committed themselves, the Chereks and Rivans moved into
                position behind them, and the Algars began slashing their flanks. When the Murgo assault began to
                falter, the Mimbrate knights made their charge."
            </p>
            <p>"It was absolutely splendid!" Lelldorin exclaimed, his eyes very bright. There was a bandage around the
                young Asturian's upper arm, but he seemed to have forgotten that it was there as he gesticulated wildly.
            </p>
            <p>"Just at the point when the Murgos were completely confused, there was a sound like thunder, and the
                knights came curving around the side of a hill with their lances advanced and their pennons streaming.
            </p>
            <p>They bore down on the Murgos - a wave of solid steel - and the hoofs of their horses shook the earth. And
                then at the last moment, they all lowered their lances. It was like watching a wave break. And then they
                hit the Murgos with a great crash, and they didn't even slow down. They rode through them as if they
                weren't even there! They absolutely crushed them, and then we all ran in to finish up. It was glorious!"
            </p>
            <p>"He's as bad as Mandorallen, isn't he?" Barak observed to Hettar.</p>
            <p>"I think it's in their blood," Hettar replied sagely.</p>
            <p>"Did any of them get away?" Anheg asked.</p>
            <p>Barak gave his cousin an evil grin. "After it got dark, we could hear a few of them trying to crawl
                away.
            </p>
            <p>That's when Relg and his Ulgos went out to tidy up. Don't worry, Anheg. Nobody's going to report back to
                Taur Urgas."
            </p>
            <p>"He is likely to be waiting for news, isn't he?" Anheg grinned.</p>
            <p>"I hope he's patient, then," Barak replied, "because he'll be waiting for a long time."</p>
            <p>Ariana, her face somber, took Lelldorin to task very firmly for his lack of discretion, even as she
                tended his wound. Her words far surpassed a simple scolding. She grew eloquent, and her lengthy,
                involuted sentences gave her remonstrance a depth and scope that reduced her young man very nearly to
                tears. His wound, admittedly minor, became a symbol of his careless lack of regard for her. Her
                expression grew martyred, and his grew anguished. Ce'Nedra observed how neatly Ariana twisted each of
                the young man's lame excuses into an even greater personal injury, and filed this excellent technique
                away in a compartment of her complex little mind for future use. True, Garion was somewhat brighter than
                Lelldorin, but the tactic would probably work on him too, if she practiced a little.
            </p>
            <p>Taiba's meeting with Relg, on the other hand, involved no words. The beautiful Marag woman who had
                emerged from the slave pens beneath Rak Cthol only to enter a slavery even more profound, flew to the
                Ulgo fanatic's side upon his return. With a low cry, she unthinkingly embraced him. Relg flinched away
                from her, but the almost automatic, "Don't touch me," seemed to die on his lips, and his eyes went very

            </p>
            <p>wide as she clung to him. Then Taiba remembered his aversion and helplessly let her arms drop, but her
                violet eyes glowed as they drank in his pale, large-eyed face. Then slowly, almost as if he were putting
                his arm into a fire, Relg reached out and took her hand. A brief look of incredulity crossed her face,
                followed almost immediately by a slow blush. They looked into each other's eyes for a moment, then
                walked off together, hand in hand. Taiba's eyes were demurely downcast, but there hovered about her
                rich, sensual mouth a tiny little smile of triumph.
            </p>
            <p>The victory over the Murgo column raised the spirits of the army tremendously. The heat and dust no
                longer seemed to sap their energy as it had during the first few days of the march, and a growing sense
                of camaraderie grew between the diversified units as they pushed steadily eastward.
            </p>
            <p>It took them four more days of steady marching to reach the headwaters of the River Mardu and another day
                to push on down along the tumbling flow to a spot where the ships could safely be launched. Hettar and
                his Algar patrols ranged far ahead and reported that there remained only one more stretch of rapids
                about ten leagues ahead before the river settled into tranquility on the Thullish plain.
            </p>
            <p>"We can portage around the rapids," King Anheg declared. "Let's get these ships into the water. We've
                lost enough time already."
            </p>
            <p>There was a rather high earthbank at that point, but the army attacked it vigorously with shovels and
                mattocks, and it was soon reduced to a sloping ramp. One by one the ships were rolled down the ramp into
                the water.
            </p>
            <p>"We'll need a while to raise the masts," Anheg said.</p>
            <p>"Leave that until later," Rhodar told him.</p>
            <p>Anheg looked at him sharply.</p>
            <p>"You're not going to be able to use your sails anyway, Anheg, and the masts stick up too high. The
                stupidest Thull in the world will know what's going on if he sees a forest of ship masts coming down the
                river toward him."
            </p>
            <p>It was evening by the time the ships had all been launched and Polgara led the princess, Ariana and Taiba
                on board Barak's ship. A breeze coming upriver gently rippled the surface of the water and set the ship
                to rocking slowly. Beyond the watchfires, the Thullish grassland stretched as if forever beneath a
                purpling sky where, one by one, the stars were emerging.
            </p>
            <p>"How far is it to Thull Mardu?" Ce'Nedra asked Barak.</p>
            <p>The big man pulled at his beard, squinting downriver. "One day to the rapids," he replied, "then one day
                to make the portage around them. Then about two days after that."
            </p>
            <p>"Four days," she said in a small voice. He nodded.</p>
            <p>"I wish it was over," she sighed.</p>
            <p>"All in good time, Ce'Nedra," he told her. "All in good time."</p>
        </chapter>
        <chapter number="15">
            <p>THE SHIPS WERE horribly crowded, even though scarcely half the army could squeeze aboard them. The Algar
                clansmen and the Mimbrate knights patrolled the banks as the Chereks rowed downriver toward the rapids,
                and those infantry elements that could not be carried by the ships rode in close files on the spare
                horses of the cavalry.
            </p>
            <p>The Thullish grasslands on either side of the river were gently rolling, long hillsides covered with
                deep, sun-browned grass. Just back from the river there were sparse clusters of the twisted, sprucelike
                trees that had dotted the lower foothills, and near the water itself rose thickets of willow and
                creeping brambles. The sky remained clear, and it was still hot, though the river added enough moisture
                to the air to alleviate the parched aridity that had plagued men and horses alike in the vast, stony
                uplands. It was an alien landscape for all of them, and the cavalry patrolling the banks rode warily
                with their hands close to their weapons.
            </p>
            <p>And then they rounded a wide bend and saw the white, tumbling water of the rapids ahead. Barak swung the
                tiller of his big ship over and beached her. "Looks like it's time to get out and walk," he grunted.
            </p>
            <p>A dispute had arisen near the bow of the ship. The brown-bearded King Fulrach was loudly protesting the
                decision to leave his supply wagons behind at the rapids. "I didn't bring them all this way just to
                leave them sitting here," he declared with uncharacteristic heat.
            </p>
            <p>"They take too long to get anyplace," Anheg told him. "We're in a hurry, Fulrach. I've got to get my
                ships past Thull Mardu before the Murgos or the Malloreans wake up to what we're doing."
            </p>
            <p>"You didn't object to having them along when you got hungry or thirsty in the uplands," Fulrach told him
                angrily.
            </p>
            <p>"That was then. This is now. I've got to take care of my ships."</p>
            <p>"And I'm going to take care of my wagons."</p>
            <p>"They'll be all right, Fulrach," Rhodar said placatingly. "We do have to hurry, and your wagons can't
                move fast enough to keep up."
            </p>
            <p>"If somebody comes along and burns them, you're going to get very hungry before we get back to the forts,
                Rhodar."
            </p>
            <p>"We'll leave men to guard them, Fulrach. Be reasonable. You worry too much."</p>
            <p>"Somebody's got to. You Alorns seem to forget that the fighting's only half of it."</p>
            <p>"Stop acting like an old woman, Fulrach," Anheg said bluntly. Fulrach's face grew very cold. "I don't
                know that I care for that last remark, Anheg," he said stiffly. Then he turned on his heel and stalked
                away.
            </p>
            <p>"What's got into him?" the King of Cherek asked innocently.</p>
            <p>"Anheg, if you don't learn how to keep your mouth shut, we might have to muzzle you," Rhodar told him.
            </p>
            <p>"I thought we came here to fight Angaraks," Brand said mildly. "Have the rules been changed?"</p>
            <p>The irritable bickering among her friends worried Ce'Nedra, and she went to Polgara with her concern.</p>
            <p>"It's nothing all that important, dear," the lady replied as she scrubbed Errand's neck. "The upcoming
                battle's got them a bit edgy, that's all."
            </p>
            <p>"But they're men," Ce'Nedra protested, "trained warriors."</p>
            <p>"What does that have to do with it?" Polgara asked, reaching for a towel.</p>
            <p>The princess couldn't think of an answer.</p>
            <p>The portage at the rapids went smoothly, and the ships reentered the river below the tumbling stretch of
                seething white-water by late afternoon. Ce'Nedra by now was virtually ill as a result of the almost
                unbearable tension. All the months she had spent in raising the army and marching eastward were about to
                come to a final culmination. Within two days, they would hurl themselves at the walls of Thull Mardu.
                Was it the right time? Was it, in fact, really necessary? Couldn't they just portage around the city and
                avoid the battle entirely? Although the Alorn kings had assured her that the city had to be neutralized,
                Ce'Nedra's doubts grew with each mile. What if this was a mistake?
            </p>
            <p>The princess worried and fretted and worried some more as she stood at the prow of Barak's ship, staring
                at the broad river winding through the Thullish grasslands.
            </p>
            <p>Finally, just at evening of the second day after the portage, Hettar galloped back and reined in his
                horse on the north bank of the river. He motioned with his arm, and Barak swung his tiller over, angling
                the big ship in closer to the bank.
            </p>
            <p>"The city's about two leagues ahead," the tall Algar called across the intervening space. "If you get too
                much closer, they'll see you from the walls."
            </p>
            <p>"This is close enough, then," Rhodar decided. "Pass the word to anchor the ships. We'll wait here until
                dark."
            </p>
            <p>Barak nodded and made a quick gesture to a waiting sailor. The man quickly raised a tall pole with a bit
                of bright red bunting nailed to its tip, and the fleet behind them slowed in answer to the signal. There
                was a creaking of windlasses as the anchors settled to the bottom, and the ships rocked and swung
                sluggishly in the current.
            </p>
            <p>"I still don't like this part," Anheg growled morosely. "Too many things can go wrong in the dark."</p>
            <p>"They'll go wrong for them, too," Brand told him.</p>
            <p>"We've been over it a dozen times, Anheg," Rhodar said. "We all agreed that it's the best plan."</p>
            <p>"It's never been done before," Anheg said.</p>
            <p>"That's the whole point, isn't it?" Varana suggested. "The people inside the city won't expect it."</p>
            <p>"Are you sure your men will be able to see where they're going?" Anheg demanded of Relg.</p>
            <p>The zealot nodded. He was wearing his cowled leaf mail shirt and was carefully testing the edge of his
                hook-pointed knife. "What you think of as darkness is normal light for us," he replied.
            </p>
            <p>Anheg scowled at the purpling sky overhead. "I hate being the first one to try something new," he
                announced.
            </p>
            <p>They waited as evening settled on the plain. From the thickets at the river's edge, birds clucked
                sleepily, and the frogs began their evening symphony. Slowly out of the gathering darkness, the cavalry
                units began to group up along the banks. The Mimbrate knights on their great chargers massed into ranks,
                and the Algar clansmen spread like a dark sea beyond them. Commanding the south bank were Cho-Hag and
                Korodullin.
            </p>
            <p>The north was led by Hettar and Mandorallen.</p>
            <p>Slowly it grew darker.</p>
            <p>A young Mimbrate knight who had been injured during the attack on the Murgo column stood leaning against
                the rail, looking pensively out into the twilight. The knight had dark, curly hair and the snowy
                complexion of a young girl. His shoulders were broad, his neck columnar, and his eyes had an open
                innocence in them. His expression, however, was faintly melancholy.
            </p>
            <p>The waiting had become unbearable, and Ce'Nedra had to talk to someone. She leaned on the rail beside the
                young man. "Why so sad, Sir Knight?" she asked him quietly.
            </p>
            <p>"Because I am forbidden to take part in this night's adventure by reason of this slight injury, your
                Majesty,"
            </p>
            <p>he replied, touching his splinted arm. He seemed unsurprised by her presence or by the fact that she had
                spoken to him.
            </p>
            <p>"Do you hate the Angaraks so much that missing the chance to kill them causes you pain?" Ce'Nedra's
                question was gently mocking.
            </p>
            <p>"Nay, my Lady," he answered. "I have no malice in me for any man, whatever his race. What I lament is
                being denied the chance to try my skills in the contest."
            </p>
            <p>"Contest? Is that how you think of it?"</p>
            <p>"Assuredly, your Majesty. In what other light should it be considered? I hold no personal rancor toward
                the men of Angarak, and it is improper to hate throe opponent in a test of arms. Some few men have
                fallen beneath my lance or my sword at diverse tourneys, but I have never hated any of them. Much to the
                contrary, I have had some affection for them as we strove with one another."
            </p>
            <p>"But you were trying to cripple them." Ce'Nedra was startled at the young man's casual attitude.</p>
            <p>"It is a part of the contest, your Majesty. A true test of arms may not be decided save by the injury or
                death of one of the combatants."
            </p>
            <p>"What's your name, Sir Knight?" she asked him.</p>
            <p>"I am Sir Beridel," he replied, "son of Sir Andorig, Baron of Vo Enderig."</p>
            <p>"The man with the apple tree?"</p>
            <p>"The very same, your Majesty." The young man seemed pleased that she had heard of his father and the
                strange duty Belgarath had imposed on him. "My father now rides at the right hand of King Korodullin. I
                would ride with them this night but for this stroke of ill fortune." He looked sadly at his broken arm.
            </p>
            <p>"There will be other nights, Sir Beridel," she assured him, "and other contests."</p>
            <p>"Truly, your Majesty," he agreed. His face brightened momentarily, but then he sighed and went back to
                his somber brooding.
            </p>
            <p>Ce'Nedra drifted away, leaving him to his thoughts.</p>
            <p>"You can't really talk to them, you know," a rough voice said to her from the shadows. It was Beldin, the
                ugly hunchback.
            </p>
            <p>"He doesn't seem to be afraid of anything," Ce'Nedra said a bit nervously. The foul-mouthed sorcerer
                always made her nervous.
            </p>
            <p>"He's a Mimbrate Arend," Beldin snorted. "He doesn't have enough brains to be afraid."</p>
            <p>"Are all the men in the army like him?"</p>
            <p>"No. Most of them are afraid, but they'll go through with the attack anyway - for a variety of
                reasons."
            </p>
            <p>"And you?" she could not help asking. "Are you afraid too?"</p>
            <p>"My fears are a bit more exotic," he said dryly.</p>
            <p>"Such as?"</p>
            <p>"We've been at this for a very long time - Belgarath, Pol, the twins and I - and I'm more concerned about
                something going wrong than I am about my own personal safety."
            </p>
            <p>"How do you mean, wrong?"</p>
            <p>"The Prophecy is very complex - and it doesn't say everything. The two possible outcomes of all this are
                still absolutely balanced as far as I can tell. Something very, very slight could tip that balance one
                way or the other. It could be something that I've overlooked. That's what I'm afraid of."
            </p>
            <p>"All we can do is the best we can."</p>
            <p>"That might not be enough."</p>
            <p>"What else can we do?"</p>
            <p>"I don't know - and that's what worries me."</p>
            <p>"Why worry about something if you can't do anything about it?"</p>
            <p>"Now you're starting to sound like Belgarath. He tends to shrug things off and trust to his luck
                sometimes. I like things a little neater." He stared off into the darkness. "Stay close to Pol tonight,
                little girl," he said after a moment. "Don't get separated from her. It might take you someplace you
                hadn't planned to go, but you're supposed to stay with her, no matter what."
            </p>
            <p>"What does that mean?"</p>
            <p>"I don't know what it means," he retorted irritably. "All I know is that you and she and the blacksmith
                and that stray child you picked up are supposed to stay together. Something unexpected is going to
                happen."
            </p>
            <p>"You mean a disaster? We must warn the others."</p>
            <p>"We don't know that it's a disaster," he replied. "That's the whole problem. It might be necessary, and
                if it is, we don't want to tamper with it. I think we've about run this discussion into the ground. Go
                find Polgara and stay with her."
            </p>
            <p>"Yes, Beldin," Ce'Nedra said meekly.</p>
            <p>As the stars began to come out, the anchors were raised and the Cherek fleet began to slip quietly
                downriver toward Thull Mardu. Though they were still some miles above the city, commands were issued in
                hoarse whispers, and the men all took great care to avoid making noise as they shifted their weapons and
                equipment, tightening belts, giving their armor quick, last-minute checks and settling their helmets
                more firmly on their heads.
            </p>
            <p>Amid ships, Relg was leading his Ulgos in a quiet religious service, muttering the harsh gutturals of the
                Ulgo tongue in a scarcely audible murmur. Their pale faces had been smeared with soot, and they looked
                like so many shadows as they knelt in prayer to their strange God.
            </p>
            <p>"They're the key to the whole thing," Rhodar observed quietly to Polgara as he watched the devotions of
                the Ulgos. "Are you sure that Relg is all right for this? Sometimes he seems a bit unstable."
            </p>
            <p>"He'll be fine," Polgara replied. "The Ulgos have even more reason to hate Torak than you Alorns do."</p>
            <p>The drifting ships slowly rounded a wide bend in the river, and there, a half mile downstream, stood the
                walled city of Thull Mardu, rising from its island in the middle of the river. There were a few torches
                atop the walls, and a faint glow rising from within. Barak turned and, shielding it with his body, he
                briefly uncovered a muffled lantern, letting out a single flicker of light. The anchors sank very slowly
                through the dark waters toward the riverbottom; with a very faint creak of ropes, the ships slowed, then
                stopped.
            </p>
            <p>Somewhere inside the city a dog began to bark excitedly. Then a door banged open, and the barking cut off
                suddenly with a yelp of pain.
            </p>
            <p>"I don't have much use for a man who kicks his own dog," Barak muttered.</p>
            <p>Relg and his men moved very quietly to the rail and began to clamber down ropes into the small boats
                waiting below.
            </p>
            <p>Ce'Nedra watched breathlessly, straining with her eyes to see in the darkness. The very faint starlight
                briefly showed her several shadows drifting down toward the city. Then the shadows were gone. Behind
                them there was a faint splash of an oar, followed by an angrily hissed admonition. The princess turned
                and saw a moving tide of small boats coming downriver from the anchored fleet. The spearhead of the
                assault slid silently by, following Relg and his Ulgos toward the fortified island city of the Thulls.
            </p>
            <p>"Are you sure there are enough of them?" Anheg whispered to Rhodar.</p>
            <p>The rotund King of Drasnia nodded. "All they have to do is secure a landing place for us and hold the
                gate once the Ulgos get it open," he murmured. "There's enough of them for that."
            </p>
            <p>A faint night breeze rippled the surface of the river, setting the ship to rocking. Unable to bear the
                suspense any longer, Ce'Nedra lifted her fingertips to the amulet Garion had given her so many months
                before. As always, a buzz of conversation filled her ears.
            </p>
            <p>"Yaga, for gohek vilta." It was Relg's harsh voice, speaking in a whisper. "Ka tak. feedh."</p>
            <p>"Well?" Polgara asked, one eyebrow slightly raised.</p>
            <p>"I can't tell what they're saying," Ce'Nedra replied helplessly. "They're talking in Ulgo."</p>
            <p>A strangled groan quite suddenly seemed to come from the amulet itself and then was quickly and horribly
                cut off.
            </p>
            <p>"I - I think they just killed somebody," Ce'Nedra said in a quavering voice.</p>
            <p>"It's started then," Anheg said with a certain grim satisfaction. Ce'Nedra pulled her fingertips from the
                amulet. She could no longer bear to listen to the sound of men dying in the dark.
            </p>
            <p>They waited.</p>
            <p>Then someone screamed, a scream filled with a terrible agony.</p>
            <p>"That's it!" Barak declared. "That's the signal! Pull the anchor!" he shouted to his men.</p>
            <p>Very suddenly beneath the high, dark walls of Thull Mardu, two separate fires flared up, and shadowy
                figures could be seen moving about them. At the same moment, there was a clanking rattle of heavy chains
                inside the city and a creaking groan as a broad gate swung ponderously down to form a bridge across the
                narrow north channel of the river.
            </p>
            <p>"Man your oars!" Barak roared to his crew. He swung his tiller hard over, steering toward the rapidly
                lowering bridge.
            </p>
            <p>More torches appeared along the tops of the walls, and there were shouts of alarm. Somewhere an iron bell
                began to clang a note of desperate urgency.
            </p>
            <p>"It worked!" Anheg exclaimed, gleefully pounding Rhodar on the back. "It actually worked!"</p>
            <p>"Of course it worked," Rhodar replied, his voice also jubilant. "Don't pound on me so hard, Anheg. I
                bruise easily."
            </p>
            <p>All need for silence was gone now, and a great roar went up from the massed fleet following in Barak's
                wake. Torches flared, and the faces of the troops lining the rails were bathed in their ruddy glow.
            </p>
            <p>A great splash suddenly erupted from the river twenty yards to the right of Barak's ship, showering
                everyone on deck with a deluge of water.
            </p>
            <p>"Catapult!" Barak shouted, pointing at the walls looming ahead. Like a huge, preying insect, the
                heavy-beamed frame of the siege-engine balanced atop the wall, its long throwing arm already cocking
                back to cast another boulder at the approaching fleet. Then the arm stopped as a storm of arrows swept
                the top of the wall clean. A crowd of Drasnians, easily identifiable by the long pikes they carried,
                overran the position.
            </p>
            <p>"Watch out, down there," one of them roared into the confusion at the base of the wall, and the siege
                engine ponderously toppled outward and fell with a crash onto the rocks below.
            </p>
            <p>There was a thunder of hoofs across the now-lowered bridge, and the Mimbrate knights crashed into the
                city.
            </p>
            <p>"As soon as we tie up to the bridge, I want you and the princess and the other ladies to go to the north
                bank," King Rhodar said tersely to Polgara. "Get back out of harm's way. This will probably take the
                rest of the night, and there's no point in exposing any of you to any accidents."
            </p>
            <p>"Very well, Rhodar," Polgara agreed. "And don't you do anything foolish, either. You're a rather large
                target, you know."
            </p>
            <p>"I'll be all right, Polgara - but I'm not going to miss this." He laughed then, a strangely boyish laugh.
                "I haven't had so much fun in years," he declared.
            </p>
            <p>Polgara gave him a quick look. "Men!" she said in a tone that said everything.</p>
            <p>A guard of Mimbrate knights escorted the ladies and Errand perhaps a thousand yards upstream to an
                indented cove on the north bank of the stream, well away from the press of the horsemen rushing toward
                the beleaguered city. The cove had a gently sloping sand beach and was protected on three sides by
                steep, grass-covered banks. Durnik the smith and Olban quickly raised a tent for them, built a small
                fire, and then climbed up the bank to watch the attack.
            </p>
            <p>"It's going according to plan," Durnik reported from his vantage point. "The Cherek ships are lining up
                side by side across the south channel. As soon as they get the planking in place, the troops on the
                other side will be able to cross."
            </p>
            <p>"Can you tell if the men inside have taken the south gate yet?" Olban demanded, peering toward the
                city.
            </p>
            <p>"I can't tell for sure," Durnik replied. "There's fighting going on in that part of the city, though."
            </p>
            <p>"I'd give anything to be there," Olban lamented.</p>
            <p>"You stay right where you are, young man," Polgara told him firmly. "You appointed yourself bodyguard to
                the Rivan Queen, and you're not going to go running off just because things are more interesting
                someplace else."
            </p>
            <p>"Yes, Lady Polgara," the young Rivan answered, suddenly abashed. "It's just "</p>
            <p>"Just what?"</p>
            <p>"I wish I knew what was happening, that's all. My father and my brothers are in the middle of the
                fighting, and I have to stand here and watch."
            </p>
            <p>A sudden great belch of flame shot up from inside the walls to illuminate the river with sooty red
                light.
            </p>
            <p>Polgara sighed. "Why do they always have to bum things?" she asked sadly.</p>
            <p>"It adds to the confusion, I suppose," Durnik replied.</p>
            <p>"Perhaps," Polgara said, "but I've seen this happen too many times before. It's always the same. There
                always has to be a fire. I don't believe I care to watch any more of this." She turned her back on the
                burning city and walked slowly away from the riverbank.
            </p>
            <p>The night was interminable. Toward dawn, as the stars began to fade from the paling sky, the Princess
                Ce'Nedra, drawn with fatigue, stood atop a grassy bank near the cove, watching with a kind of sick
                fascination as the city of Thull Mardu died. Entire districts seemed to be in flames, and great
                fountains of

            </p>
            <p>orange sparks belched toward the sky as roofs caved in and buildings collapsed. What had seemed so
                stirring, so glorious in her anticipation had turned out to be something quite different in reality, and
                she was sick at what she had done. She still, nonetheless, brought her fingertips up to touch the amulet
                at her throat.
            </p>
            <p>She had to know what was happening. No matter how horrible the events were in the city, not knowing what
                was happening was even worse.
            </p>
            <p>"Sort of a nice little fight," she heard King Anheg say. The King of Cherek seemed to be someplace very
                high - atop the walls of the city perhaps.
            </p>
            <p>"Pretty routine," Barak, Earl of Trellheim, replied. "The Murgo garrison fought pretty well, but the
                Thulls kept falling all over themselves trying to surrender."
            </p>
            <p>"What did you do with all of them?" King Cho-Hag asked.</p>
            <p>"We herded them into the central square," Barak answered. "They've been amusing themselves by killing the
                Grolims we flushed out of the temple."
            </p>
            <p>Anheg suddenly chuckled, an evil sort of sound. "How's Grodeg?" he asked.</p>
            <p>"It looks like he's going to live," Barak said.</p>
            <p>"That's a shame. When I saw that axe sticking out of his back, I thought somebody's solved one of my
                problems for me."
            </p>
            <p>"It was too low," Barak said rather mournfully. "It broke his spine, but it didn't hit anything else
                significant.
            </p>
            <p>He won't be walking any more, but he's still breathing."</p>
            <p>"You can't depend on a Murgo to do anything right," Anheg said in disgust.</p>
            <p>"They did thin out the Bear-cult pretty thoroughly," Barak noted cheerfully. "I don't think there are
                more than two dozen of them left. They fought pretty well, though."
            </p>
            <p>"That's what they were here for. How long do you think it will be before daylight?"</p>
            <p>"Half an hour, maybe."</p>
            <p>"Where's Rhodar?"</p>
            <p>"He and Fulrach are sacking the warehouses," King Cho-Hag replied. "The Murgos had some supply dumps
                here. Fulrach wants to confiscate them."
            </p>
            <p>"He would," Anheg said. "Maybe we'd better send somebody for them. It's getting on toward the time when
                we'll want to think about pulling out of here. As soon as it gets light, all this smoke's going to
                announce what we've done to anyone within twenty leagues. It's about time to start the fleet moving, and
                it's a long march back to the forts on top of the escarpment."
            </p>
            <p>"How long will it take you to get to the Sea of the East?" Cho-Hag asked.</p>
            <p>"A couple of days," Anheg told him. "You can move a ship pretty fast when you've got the current behind
                you. It will take your army a week at least to get back to the forts, won't it?"
            </p>
            <p>"Probably," Cho-Hag said. "The infantry can't move all that fast. There's Brendig! I'll send him to fetch
                Rhodar." He shouted down to the Sendar. "Colonel Brendig, see if you can find Rhodar. Ask him to join
                us."
            </p>
            <p>"What's that?" Barak asked suddenly.</p>
            <p>"What's what?" Anheg demanded.</p>
            <p>"I thought I saw something out there - way to the south - where you can just start to make out that
                hilltop."
            </p>
            <p>"I don't see anything."</p>
            <p>"It was just a flicker - something moving."</p>
            <p>"Probably a Murgo scout creeping in for a look." Anheg laughed shortly. "I don't imagine we'll be able to
                keep what happened here a secret for very long."
            </p>
            <p>"There it is again," Barak said.</p>
            <p>"I saw it that time, too," King Cho-Hag agreed.</p>
            <p>There was a long silence as the sky imperceptibly grew lighter. Ce'Nedra held her breath.</p>
            <p>"Belar!" Anheg swore in a stunned voice. "They stretch for miles!"</p>
            <p>"Lelldorin!" Barak shouted down from the wall. "Brendig's gone to get Rhodar. Go find them and tell them
                to get up here at once. The plain to the south is covered with Murgos."
            </p>
        </chapter>
        <chapter number="16">
            <p>"LADY POLGARA!" CE'NEDRA Cried, jerking back the flap of the tent. "Lady Polgara!"</p>
            <p>"What is it, Ce'Nedra?" Polgara's voice came from the darkness inside the tent.</p>
            <p>"Barak and Anheg are up on the walls of the city," the princess said in a frightened voice. "They just
                saw a Murgo army coming up from the south."
            </p>
            <p>Polgara came quickly out into the firelight, holding the sleepy Errand by the hand. "Where's Beldin?" she
                demanded.
            </p>
            <p>"I haven't seen him since early last night."</p>
            <p>Polgara raised her face and closed her eyes. A moment or so later there was a rushing sound of wings, and
                the large hawk settled to the sand not far from their flickering fire.
            </p>
            <p>Beldin was swearing sulfurously even as he shimmered and blurred back into his natural shape.</p>
            <p>"How did they slip past you, Uncle?" Polgara asked him.</p>
            <p>"There are Grolims with them," he growled, still sizzling the air around him with oaths. "The Grolims
                could feel me watching, so the troops moved only at night, and the Grolims shielded them."
            </p>
            <p>"Where did they hide in the daytime?"</p>
            <p>"In the Thullish villages, apparently. There are dozens of communities out there. It never occurred to me
                to pay all that much attention to them." He began to swear again, berating himself savagely for having
                missed the movement of the Murgo army.
            </p>
            <p>"There's no point in swearing about it, Uncle," Polgara told him coolly. "It's done, now."</p>
            <p>"Unfortunately there's a bit more, Pol," the sorcerer told her. "There's another army at least as big
                coming in from the north - Malloreans, Nadraks, and Thulls. We're caught right between them."
            </p>
            <p>"How long have we got before they reach us?" Polgara asked. Beldin shrugged. "Not long. The Murgos have
                some rough ground to cross - probably about an hour. The Malloreans will be here in quite a bit less."
            </p>
            <p>Polgara began to curse fervently under her breath. "Go to Rhodar," she told the hunchback. "Tell him that
                we have to release Anheg's fleet immediately - before the Angaraks can bring up catapults and destroy
                the ships where they're anchored."
            </p>
            <p>The deformed man nodded and stooped slightly, curving his arms out like wings even as he began to waver
                and change.
            </p>
            <p>"Olban," Polgara called to the young Rivan, "go find Sir Mandorallen and Lord Hettar. Send them to me at
                once. Hurry."
            </p>
            <p>Olban gave her one startled look, then ran for his horse.</p>
            <p>Durnik the smith came sliding down the grassy bank onto their little beach. His face was grave. "You and
                the ladies must leave at once, Mistress Pol," he told her. "There's going to be fighting here, and the
                middle of a battle's no place for any of you."
            </p>
            <p>"I'm not going anywhere, Durnik," she replied with a trace of irritation. "I started all this, and I'm
                going to see it through."
            </p>
            <p>Ariana had gone back into the tent as soon as the situation became clear to her. She now emerged again,
                carrying the stout canvas bag in which she kept her medical supplies. "Have I thy permission to leave,
                Lady Polgara?" she asked with a certain cool professionalism. "In battle men are injured, and I must go
                make preparations for their care. This spot is somewhat too remote and confined to receive the wounded."
            </p>
            <p>Polgara gave her a quick look. "All right," she agreed. "Just be careful not to get too close to the
                fighting."
            </p>
            <p>Taiba pulled on her cloak. "I'll go with you," she told Ariana. "I don't know that much about it, but you
                can teach me as we go along."
            </p>
            <p>"Go help them get set up, Durnik," Polgara told the smith. "Then come back here."</p>
            <p>Durnik nodded gravely and helped the two women up the steep bank. Mandorallen thundered up on his charger
                with Hettar at his side. "You know what's happened?" Polgara demanded.
            </p>
            <p>Mandorallen nodded.</p>
            <p>"Is there any possibility of withdrawing before the enemy forces arrive?"</p>
            <p>"Nay, my Lady Polgara," the great knight replied. "They are too close. Moreover, our purpose has ever
                been to gain passage for the ships of Cherek into the Sea of the East. We must buy them time to sail
                beyond the reach of the siege engines of the Angaraks."
            </p>
            <p>"I didn't want this," Polgara said angrily and she began to mutter curses again.</p>
            <p>Brand, the gray-cloaked Rivan Warder, accompanied by General Varana, rode up to join Mandorallen and
                Hettar at the top of the steep bank. The four of them dismounted and slid down the bank to the sand.
            </p>
            <p>"We've begun evacuating the city," the big Rivan said in his deep voice, "and most of the fleet is
                pulling anchor. We're holding just enough ships to maintain the bridges across the south channel."
            </p>
            <p>"Is there any possibility of putting the entire army on one bank or the other?" Polgara asked him.</p>
            <p>He shook his head. "There isn't time, Polgara."</p>
            <p>"We're going to be divided by the river," she pointed out, "and neither force is going to be strong
                enough to meet the Angaraks coming against it."
            </p>
            <p>"A tactical necessity, my dear Lady Polgara," General Varana told her. "We have to hold both banks until
                the fleet is clear."
            </p>
            <p>"I think Rhodar misjudged the Angarak intentions," Brand said. "He was so sure that Taur Urgas and</p>
            <p>'Zakath would both want to avoid taking casualties that he didn't consider this possibility."</p>
            <p>General Varana clasped his muscular hands behind his back and limped back and forth along the little
                beach, his face creased with thought. "I think I begin to understand the meaning of that Murgo column we
                destroyed in the uplands," he said.
            </p>
            <p>"Your Grace?" Mandorallen asked, puzzled.</p>
            <p>"It was a test of our commitment," Varana explained. "The Angaraks needed to know when we were making our
                major move. One of the basic rules of war is not to become involved in serious conflicts if what you're
                doing is merely diversionary. That column was bait. Unfortunately, we took it."
            </p>
            <p>"You mean we shouldn't have attacked the column?" Hettar asked him.</p>
            <p>Varana made a rueful face. "Apparently not. It gave away our intentions - let them know that this
                expedition was not a diversion. I underestimated Taur Urgas. He threw away a thousand men just to find
                out what we were up to."
            </p>
            <p>"What now?" Hettar asked.</p>
            <p>"We get ready to fight," Varana said. "I wish we had better terrain for it, but I suppose we'll have to
                make do with what we have."
            </p>
            <p>Hettar looked out across the river, his hawkface hungry. "I wonder if I've got time to make it over to
                the south bank," he mused.
            </p>
            <p>"One side or the other," Brand said, looking puzzled. "What's the difference?"</p>
            <p>"The Murgos are over there," Hettar replied. "I don't really have anything against Malloreans."</p>
            <p>"This isn't a personal fight, Lord Hettar," Varana pointed out.</p>
            <p>"It is with me," Hettar said grimly.</p>
            <p>"We must needs see to the safety of Lady Polgara and the princess," Mandorallen said. "Mayhap an escort
                should be provided to convey them back to the forts atop the escarpment."
            </p>
            <p>Brand shook his head. "The region is likely to be patrolled heavily," he disagreed. "It wouldn't be
                safe."
            </p>
            <p>"He's right, Mandorallen," Polgara told the knight. "Besides, you need every man you've got right
                here."
            </p>
            <p>She looked off toward the northeast. "Then, too, there's that." She pointed toward a heavy cloudbank that
                had begun to stain the sky just above the horizon. The clouds were an inky black, seething and rolling
                and illuminated from within by fitful flickers of lightning.
            </p>
            <p>"A storm?" General Varana asked, looking a bit surprised.</p>
            <p>"Not at this time of year - and certainly not from that direction," Polgara replied. "The Grolims are up
                to something, and that's going to be my fight. Deploy your forces, gentlemen. If there's going to be a
                battle, let's be ready for it."
            </p>
            <p>"The ships are moving," Durnik reported as he and Olban came back to the sheltered little cove, "and the
                troops are leaving the city."
            </p>
            <p>King Rhodar rode up. His broad face was streaked with soot and perspiration. "Anheg's leaving," he said,
                swinging down from his saddle with a grunt.
            </p>
            <p>"Where's Fulrach?" Brand asked.</p>
            <p>"He's taking the bulk of the troops across to the south bank."</p>
            <p>"Isn't that going to leave us a little undermanned on this side?" General Varana inquired politely.</p>
            <p>"That bridge is too narrow," Rhodar told him. "It would take hours to bring enough men across to make any
                difference. Brendig's already got a crew undermining the supports so that we can bring the bridge down
                before the Angaraks get here."
            </p>
            <p>"What for?" Ce'Nedra asked him.</p>
            <p>"Thull Mardu's too good a vantage point, your Highness," General Varana explained. "We don't want any
                Angaraks on the island if we can help it." He looked at King Rhodar. "Have you given any thought to
                tactics?" he asked.
            </p>
            <p>"We want to give Anheg a half a day, if possible," Rhodar replied. "The ground along the river gets
                marshy about twenty leagues downstream, and the Angaraks won't be able to get close enough to pester
                him, once he gets that far. Let's form up a conventional infantry linepikemen, the legions, Sendars, and
                so on. We'll put the archers in support and use the Algars to slash at the flanks. I want to hold the
                Mimbrate knights in reserve until the Malloreans mass up for their first charge."
            </p>
            <p>"That's not a winning tactic, if your Majesty will forgive my saying so," General Varana said.</p>
            <p>"We aren't here to win, Varana," Rhodar told him. "We're here to delay the Angaraks for about six hours
                and then withdraw. I'm not going to waste lives trying to win a battle I haven't any chance of winning."
                He turned to Hettar. "I want you to send a force of your clansmen on a sweep downriver. Tell them to
                uproot any Malloreans they find emplaced along the riverbank. The significance of the fleet still may
                have escaped 'Zakath and Taur Urgas. Angaraks aren't good sailors, so they probably don't realize what
                Anheg can do, once he gets into the Sea of the East."
            </p>
            <p>"Excuse me, your Majesty," Varana objected, "but all of your strategy - even the fleet - is merely a
                delaying action."
            </p>
            <p>"That's the whole point, Varana," Rhodar told him bluntly. "All of this is really rather insignificant.
                What's really important is going to happen in Mallorea when Belgarion reaches Cthol Mishrak. We'd better
                move, gentlemen. The Malloreans will be here before long, and we want to be ready for them."
            </p>
            <p>The cloudbank Polgara had pointed out was sweeping toward them with an alarming speed, a seething
                darkness of rolling purple, stalking forward on crooked legs of lightning. A hot wind seemed to flee out
                ahead of it, flattening the grass and whipping the manes and tails of the horses wildly. As King Rhodar
                and the others moved out to meet the approaching Mallorean army, Polgara, her face pale and her hair
                tossing behind her in the wind, climbed the grassy bank with Ce'Nedra and Durnik behind her and stood
                watching the approach of the cloud. "Take the child, Ce'Nedra," she said quite calmly. "Don't let go of
                him, no matter what happens."
            </p>
            <p>"Yes, Lady Polgara," Ce'Nedra said, holding out her arms to Errand. The child came to her immediately,
                his serious little face unafraid. She picked him up and held him close, her cheek against his.
            </p>
            <p>"Errand?" he said, pointing at the approaching storm.</p>
            <p>Then, among the ranks of their army, shadowy figures rose up out of the ground. The figures wore black
                robes and polished steel masks and carried cruel-pointed short spears. Without pausing to even think, a
                mounted young Mimbrate knight swept his broadsword from its scabbard and swung the whistling blade at
                one of the steel-masked figures. His sword passed through the figure with no effect. As he struck,
                however, a sizzling bolt of lightning struck him, seeming to attach itself to the point of his helmet.
                He stiffened convulsively as the lightning, like a writhing snake of intense light, clung to the tip of
                his steel helm.
            </p>
            <p>Smoke boiled out of the slits of his visor as he roasted inside his armor. His horse lurched forward onto
                its knees while the ghastly, flickering light engulfed them both. Then the lightning was gone, and horse
                and man collapsed, stone dead.
            </p>
            <p>Polgara hissed and then raised her voice. She did not seem to be speaking that loudly, but the effect of
                her words reached the farthest edges of the army. "Do not touch the shadows," she warned. "They're
                Grolim illusions and can't hurt you unless you touch them. They're here to draw the lightning to you, so
                stay clear of them."
            </p>
            <p>"But, Mistress Pol," Durnik protested, "the troops won't be able to hold ranks if they have to keep
                dodging the shadows."
            </p>
            <p>"I'll take care of the shadows," she replied grimly. She raised both arms above her head, her fists
                clenched.
            </p>
            <p>A look of dreadful concentration filled her face, and then she spoke a single word, opening her hands as
                she did so. The grass, which had been bending toward them in the hot wind preceding the storm, suddenly
                flattened in the opposite direction as the force of Polgara's will rippled outward. As that force passed
                over each shadowy Grolim illusion, the figures seemed to flinch, then shrivel, and then with silent
                detonations, each shadow exploded into shards and fragments of darkness.
            </p>
            <p>Polgara was gasping as the last of the shadows on the farthest edge of the army vanished, and she would
                have collapsed had Durnik not jumped to her side to support her. "Are you all right?" he asked
                worriedly.
            </p>
            <p>"Just give me a moment," she said, wilting against him. "That took a great deal of effort." She smiled at
                him, a wan little smile, and then her head drooped wearily.
            </p>
            <p>"Won't they come back?" Ce'Nedra demanded. "What I mean is, it didn't actually hurt the real Grolims, did
                it? Just their shadows."
            </p>
            <p>Polgara laughed weakly. "Oh, it hurt them, all right," she replied. "Those Grolims don't have shadows any
                more. Not one of them will ever cast a shadow again."
            </p>
            <p>"Not ever?" the princess gasped.</p>
            <p>"Not ever."</p>
            <p>Then Beldin joined them, swooping in with the wind tearing at his feathers. "We've got work to do,
                Polgara," he growled even as he shimmered into his natural shape. "We're going to have to break up this
                storm they're bringing in from the west. I talked with the twins. They'll work on the southern side of
                it, and you and I'll take this side."
            </p>
            <p>She looked at him inquiringly.</p>
            <p>"Their army's going to be advancing right behind the storm," he explained. "There's no point in trying to
                hold it back now. It's got too much momentum. What we want to do is break open the rear edge of it and
                let it spill back over the Angaraks."
            </p>
            <p>"How many Grolims are working on the storm, Uncle?" she asked him.</p>
            <p>"Who knows?" He shrugged. "But it's taking every bit of effort they can muster just to keep it under
                control. If the four of us hit the back side all at once, the pressures in the storm itself will do the
                rest."
            </p>
            <p>"Why not just let it pass over?" Durnik asked. "Our troops aren't children. They won't fall apart just
                because of a little squall."
            </p>
            <p>"This isn't just a little squall, blacksmith," Beldin said acidly. Something large and white thudded to
                the ground a few feet away. "If you get four or five of those hailstones on top of the head, you won't
                care how the battle turns out."
            </p>
            <p>"They're as big as hens' eggs," Durnik said in astonishment.</p>
            <p>"And they'll probably get bigger." Beldin turned back to Polgara. "Give me your hand," he told her. "I'll
                pass the signal to Beltira, and we'll all strike at the same time. Get ready."
            </p>
            <p>More of the hailstones thudded into the springy turf, and one particularly large one shattered into a
                thousand fragments as it crashed down on a large rock with stunning force. From the direction of the
                army came an intermittent banging as the hailstones bounced off the armor of the Mimbrate knights or
                clanged down on the hastily raised shields of the infantry.
            </p>
            <p>And then, mixed with the hail, the rain squalls struck-seething sheets of water driven before the wind
                like raging waves. It was impossible to see, and almost impossible to breathe. Olban jumped forward with
                his
            </p>
            <p>shield raised to protect Ce'Nedra and Errand. He winced once as a large hailstone struck his shoulder,
                but his shield arm did not waver.
            </p>
            <p>"It's breaking, Pol!" Beldin shouted. "Let's push it once more. Let them eat their own storm for a
                while."
            </p>
            <p>Polgara's face twisted into an agony of concentration, and then she half slumped as she and Beldin
                unleashed their combined wills at the rolling sky. The sound of it was beyond belief as the vast forces
                collided. The sky ripped suddenly apart and lightning staggered and lurched through the smoking air.
            </p>
            <p>Great, incandescent bolts crashed into each other high above, showering the earth beneath with
                fireballs.
            </p>
            <p>Men fell, charred instantly into black, steaming husks in the driving downpour, but the casualties were
                not only among the men of the west.
            </p>
            <p>The vast storm with its intolerable pressures recoiled as the combined wills of Polgara and Beldin on the
                north bank and the twins on the south bank ripped open the back edge of it, and the advancing Malloreans
                received that recoil full in the teeth. A curtain of lightning swept back across their close-packed
                ranks like an enormous, blinding broom, littering the earth with their smoking dead. As the fabric of
                Grolim sorcery which had driven the stormfront toward the river ripped apart, the gale winds suddenly
                reversed and flowed back, shrieking and howling, confounding the advancing Angaraks with rain and hail.
            </p>
            <p>From out of the center of the dreadful cloud overhead, swirling fingers of murky black twitched and
                reached down toward the earth with hideous roaring sounds. With a last, almost convulsive jerk, one of
                those huge, swirling funnels touched the earth in the midst of the redclad Malloreans. Debris sprayed up
                and out from the point of the dreadful vortex as, with ponderous immensity, it cut an erratic course two
                hundred yards wide directly through the enemy ranks. Men and horses were ripped to pieces by the insane
                winds within the swirling column of cloud, and bits of armor and shreds of red tunics - and worse -
            </p>
            <p>showered down on the stunned and terrified Malloreans on either side of the swath of absolute destruction
                moving inexorably through their midst.
            </p>
            <p>"Beautiful!" Beldin exulted, hopping up and down in a grotesque display of glee.</p>
            <p>There was the sudden sound of a great horn, and the close-packed ranks of Drasnian pikemen and Tolnedran
                legionnaires facing the faltering ranks of the Malloreans opened. From behind them, his armor streaming
                water, Mandorallen led the charge of the Mimbrate knights. Full upon the confused and demoralized
                Malloreans they fell, and the sound of the impact as they struck was a terrible, rending crash,
                punctuated by screams. Rank upon rank was crushed beneath the charge, and the terrified Malloreans
                wavered and then broke and fled. Even as they ran, the clans of Algar swept in among them from the
                flanks, their sabres flashing in the rain.
            </p>
            <p>At a second blast of Mandorallen's horn, the charging Mimbrates reined in, wheeled and galloped back,
                leaving a vast wreckage behind them.
            </p>
            <p>The rain slackened fitfully, little more than errantly passing showers now, and patches of blue appeared
                among the racing clouds overhead. The Grolim storm had broken and dispersed back across the plains of
                Mishrak ac Thull.
            </p>
            <p>Ce'Nedra looked toward the south bank and saw that the storm there had also dispersed and that the forces
                under the command of King Cho-Hag and King Korodullin were assaulting the front ranks of the demoralized
                Murgo army. Then the princess looked sharply at the south channel of the river. The last bridges of
                Cherek ships had broken loose during the violent storm, and there was now only open water on that side
                of the island. The last troops remaining in the city were streaming across the bridge over the north
                channel. A tall Sendarian lad was among the last to cross. As soon as he reached the bank, he came
                immediately upriver. As he drew nearer, Ce'Nedra recognized him. It was Rundorig, Garion's boyhood
                friend from Faldor's farm, and he was openly weeping.
            </p>
            <p>"Goodman Durnik," he sobbed as he reached them, "Doroon's dead."</p>
            <p>"What did you say?" Lady Polgara demanded, raising her tired face suddenly.</p>
            <p>"Doroon, Mistress Pol," Rundorig wept. "He drowned. We were crossing over to the south bank when the
                storm broke the ropes holding the ships. Doroon fell into the river, and he didn't know how to swim. I
                tried to save him, but he went under before I could reach him." The tall young man buried his face in
                his hands.
            </p>
            <p>Polgara's face went absolutely white, and her eyes filled with sudden tears. "Take care of him, Durnik,"
                she told the smith, then turned and walked away, her head bowed in her grief.
            </p>
            <p>"I tried, Durnik," Rundorig blurted, still sobbing. "I really tried to reach him - but there were too
                many people in my way. I couldn't get to him in time. I saw him go under, and there was nothing I could
                do."
            </p>
            <p>Durnik's face was very grave as he put his arm about the weeping boy's shoulders. The smith's eyes were
                also filled, and he said nothing. Ce'Nedra, however, could not weep. She had reached out her hand and
                plucked these unwarlike young men from their homes and dragged them halfway across the world, and now
                one of Garion's oldest friends had died in the chill waters of the River Mardu. His death was on her
                head, but she could not weep. A terrible fury suddenly filled her. She turned to Olban. "Kill them!" she
                hissed from between clenched teeth.
            </p>
            <p>"My Queen?" Olban gaped at her.</p>
            <p>"Go!" she commanded. "Take your sword and go. Kill as many Angaraks as you can - for me, Olban. Kill them
                for me!" And then she could weep.
            </p>
            <p>Olban looked first at the sobbing little princess and then at the milling ranks of the Malloreans, still
                reeling from the savagery of the Mimbrate assault. His face grew exultant as he drew his sword. "As my
                Queen commands!" he shouted and ran to his horse.
            </p>
            <p>Even as the decimated front ranks of the Malloreans fled, hurried by the sabre-wielding Algars, greater
                and greater numbers of their countrymen reached the field, and soon the low hills to the north were
                covered with them. Their red tunics made it look almost as if the earth itself were bleeding. It was not
                the Malloreans, however, who mounted the next attack. Instead, thick-bodied Thulls in mud-colored smocks
                marched reluctantly into position. Directly behind the Thulls, mounted Malloreans urged them on with
                whips.
            </p>
            <p>"Basic Mallorean strategy," Beldin growled. "'Zakath wants to let the Thulls do most of the dying. He'll
                try to save his own troops for the campaign against Taur Urgas."
            </p>
            <p>Ce'Nedra raised her tearstreaked face. "What do we do now?" she asked the misshapen sorcerer.</p>
            <p>"We kill Thulls," he said bluntly. "A charge or two by the Mimbrates ought to break their spirits. Thulls
                don't make very good soldiers, and they'll run away as soon as we give them the chance."
            </p>
            <p>Even as the sluggish forces of Mishrak ac Thull flowed like a mudslide downhill toward the solid line of
                pikemen and legionnaires, the Asturian archers just to the rear of the infantry raised their bows and
                filled the air with a solid, arching sheet of yard-long arrows. The Thulls quailed as rank after rank
                melted under the withering storm of arrows. The shouts of the Malloreans at the rear became more
                desperate, and the crack of their whips filled the air.
            </p>
            <p>And then Mandorallen's horn sounded, the ranks of infantry opened, and the armored knights of Mimbre
                charged again. The Thulls took one look at the steel-clad men and horses crashing toward them and
            </p>
            <p>immediately bolted. The Mallorean whip-men were swarmed under and trampled in the panic-stricken flight
                of the Thull army.
            </p>
            <p>"So much for the Thulls." Beldin grunted with satisfaction as he watched the rout. He grinned an evil
                grin.
            </p>
            <p>"I imagine that 'Zakath will speak firmly to King Gethell about this."</p>
            <p>Mandorallen's knights thundered back to their positions behind the infantry, and the two armies glared at
                each other across a field littered with Angarak dead.
            </p>
            <p>Ce'Nedra began to shiver as a sudden chill swept the battlefield.</p>
            <p>Although the sun had broken through the ragged clouds as the Grolim storm rapidly dispersed, there was no
                warmth to it. Even though all trace of wind had died, it grew colder. Then from the ground and from the
                dark surface of the river, tendrils of fog began to rise.
            </p>
            <p>Beldin hissed. "Polgara," he snapped to the grieving sorceress, "I need you."</p>
            <p>"Leave me alone, Uncle," she replied in a voice still choked with sorrow.</p>
            <p>"You can cry later," he told her harshly. "The Grolims are drawing the heat out of the air. If we don't
                stir up a wind, the fog's going to get so thick you'll be able to walk on it."
            </p>
            <p>She turned, and her face was very cold. "You don't respect anything, do you?" she said flatly.</p>
            <p>"Not much," he admitted, "but that's beside the point. If the Grolims can build up a good fog bank, we'll
                have the whole stinking Mallorean army on top of us before we can even see them coming. Let's go, Pol.
            </p>
            <p>People get killed; it happens. You can get sentimental about it later." He held out his gnarled, lumpy
                hand to her.
            </p>
            <p>The tendrils of fog had begun to thicken, lying in little pockets now. The littered battlefield in front
                of the infantry lines seemed to waver, and then disappeared entirely as the fog congealed into a solid
                wall of white.
            </p>
            <p>"Wind, Pol," Beldin said, taking hold of her hand. "As much wind as you can raise."</p>
            <p>The struggle which ensued then was a silent one. Polgara and Beldin, their hands joined together,
                gathered in their wills and then reached out with them, probing, searching for some weakness in the mass
                of deadcalm air that imprisoned the thickening fog along the banks of the river. Fitful little gusts of
                breeze swirled the eddying fog, then died as quickly as they had arisen.
            </p>
            <p>"Harder, Pol," Beldin urged. His ugly face streamed with rivulets of sweat as he struggled with the vast
                inertness of unmoving air.
            </p>
            <p>"It's not going to work this way, Uncle," she declared, pulling her hand free. Her face showed her own
                strain. "There's nothing to get hold of. What are the twins doing?"
            </p>
            <p>"The Hierarchs of Rak Cthol are riding with Taur Urgas," the hunchback replied. "The twins have their
                hands full dealing with them. They won't be able to help."
            </p>
            <p>Polgara straightened then, steeling herself. "We're trying to work too close," she said. "Every time we
                start a little local breeze, a dozen Grolims jump in and smother it."
            </p>
            <p>"All right," Beldin agreed.</p>
            <p>"We'll have to reach out farther," she continued. "Start the air moving somewhere out beyond their range
                so that by the time it gets here, it has so much momentum that they can't stop it."
            </p>
            <p>Beldin's eyes narrowed. "That's dangerous, Pol," he told her. "Even if we can do it, it's going to
                exhaust the both of us. If they throw anything else at us, neither of us will have any strength left to
                fight them."
            </p>
            <p>"It's a gamble, Uncle," she admitted, "but the Grolims are stubborn. They'll try to protect this fog bank
                even after all chance of maintaining it has gone. They'll get tired, too. Maybe too tired to try
                anything else."
            </p>
            <p>"I don't like maybes."</p>
            <p>"Have you got a better idea?"</p>
            <p>"Not right now, no."</p>
            <p>"All right, then."</p>
            <p>They joined hands again.</p>
            <p>It took, it seemed to the princess, an eternity. With her heart in her throat she stared at the two of
                them as they stood with their hands joined and their eyes closed - reaching out with their minds toward
                the hot, barren uplands to the west, trying with all their strength to pull that heated air down into
                the broad valley of the River Mardu. All around her, Ce'Nedra seemed to feel the oppressive chill of
                Grolim thought lying heavily on the stagnant air, holding it, resisting all effort to dissipate the
                choking fog.
            </p>
            <p>Polgara was breathing in short gasps, her chest heaving and her face twisted with an inhuman striving.
            </p>
            <p>Beldin, his knotted shoulders hunched forward, struggled like a man attempting to lift a mountain.</p>
            <p>And then Ce'Nedra caught the faintest scent of dust and dry, sunparched grass. It was only momentary, and
                she thought at first that she had imagined it. Then it came again, stronger this time, and the fog
                eddied sluggishly. But once more that faint scent died, and with it the breath of air that had carried
                it.
            </p>
            <p>Polgara groaned then, an almost strangled sound, and the fog began to swirl. The wet grass at Ce'Nedra's
                feet, drenched with droplets of mist, bent slightly, and the dusty smell of the Thullish uplands grew
                stronger.
            </p>
            <p>It seemed that the blanket of concentration that had held the fog motionless became more desperate as the
                Grolims fought to stop the quickening breeze pouring down the valley from the acrid stretches to the
                west.
            </p>
            <p>The blanket began to tatter and to fall apart as the weaker of the Grolims, pushed beyond their capacity,
                collapsed in exhaustion.
            </p>
            <p>The breeze grew stronger, became a hot wind that rippled the surface of the river. The grass bent before
                it, and the fog began to seethe like some vast living thing, writhing at the touch of the arid wind.
            </p>
            <p>Ce'Nedra could see the still-burning city of Thull Mardu now, and the infantry lines drawn up on the
                plain beside the river.
            </p>
            <p>The hot, dusty wind blew stronger, and the fog, as insubstantial as the thought that had raised it from
                the earth, dissolved, and the morning sun broke through to bathe the field in golden light.
            </p>
            <p>"Polgara!" Durnik cried in sudden alarm.</p>
            <p>Ce'Nedra whirled in time to see Polgara, her face drained deathly white, slowly toppling to the earth.
            </p>

        <chapter number="17">
            <p>LELLDORIN OF WILDANTOR had been nervously pacing back and forth along the ranks of his bowmen, stopping
                often to listen for any sound coming out of the fog from the field lying in front of the massed
                infantry. "Can you hear anything?" he asked urgently of a Tolnedran legionnaire standing nearby.
            </p>
            <p>The Tolnedran shook his head.</p>
            <p>That same whisper came out of the fog from a dozen different places.</p>
            <p>"Can you hear anything?"</p>
            <p>"Can you hear anything?"</p>
            <p>"What are they doing?"</p>
            <p>Somewhere to the front, there was a faint clink.</p>
            <p>"There!" everyone cried almost in unison.</p>
            <p>"Not yet!" Lelldorin snapped to one of his countrymen who was raising his bow. "It could be just a
                wounded Thull out there. Save your arrows."
            </p>
            <p>"Is that a breeze?" a Drasnian pikeman asked. "Please, Belar, let it be a breeze."</p>
            <p>Lelldorin stared into the fog, nervously fingering his bowstring. Then he felt a faint touch of air on
                his cheek.
            </p>
            <p>"A breeze," someone exulted.</p>
            <p>"A breeze." The phrase raced through the massed army.</p>
            <p>Then the faint breath of air died, and the fog settled again, seeming thicker than ever.</p>
            <p>Someone groaned bitterly.</p>
            <p>The fog stirred then and began to eddy sluggishly. It was a breeze! Lelldorin held his breath.</p>
            <p>The fog began to move, flowing gray over the ground like water.</p>
            <p>"There's something moving out there!" a Tolnedran barked. "Get ready!"</p>
            <p>The flowing fog moved faster, thinning, melting in the hot, dusty breeze blowing down the valley.</p>
            <p>Lelldorin strained his eyes to the front. There were moving shapes out there, no more than seventy paces
                from the infantry.
            </p>
            <p>Then, as if all its stubborn resistance had broken at once, the fog shimmered and dissolved, and the sun
                broke through. The entire field before them was filled with Malloreans. Their stealthy forward pace
                froze momentarily as they flinched in the sudden light of the sun.
            </p>
            <p>"Now!" Lelldorin shouted, raising his bow. Behind him, his archers with one universal motion followed his
                action, and the sudden release of a thousand bowstrings all at once was like some vast, thrumming note.
                A whistling sheet of arrows soared over the heads of the solidly standing infantry, seemed to hang
                motionless in the air for a moment, then hurtled into the close-packed Mallorean ranks.
            </p>
            <p>The creeping attack of the Malloreans did not waver or falter; it simply dissolved. With a vast, sighing
                groan, entire regiments fell in their tracks under the Asturian arrow storm.
            </p>
            <p>Lelldorin's hand flickered to the forest of arrows thrust point - first into the turf at his feet. He
                smoothly nocked another shaft, drew and released. And then again - and again. The sheet of arrows
                overhead was like some great slithering bridge arching over the infantry and riddling the Malloreans as
                it fell among them.
            </p>
            <p>The storm of Asturian arrows crept inexorably across the field, and the Mallorean dead piled up in
                windrows as if some enormous scythe had passed through their ranks.
            </p>
            <p>And then Sir Mandorallen's brazen horn sounded its mighty challenge, the ranks of archers and infantry
                opened, and the earth shook beneath the thunder of the charge of the Mimbrate knights.
            </p>
            <p>Demoralized by the arrow storm and the sight of that inexorable charge descending upon them, the
                Malloreans broke and fled. Laughing delightedly, Lelldorin's cousin Torasin lowered his bow to jeer at
                the backs of the routed Angaraks.
            </p>
            <p>"We did it, Lelldorin!" he shouted, still laughing. "We broke their backs!" He was half turned now, not
                facing the littered field. His bow was in his hands; his dark hair was thrown back; and his face
                reflected his exultant delight. Lelldorin would always remember him so.
            </p>
            <p>"Tor! Look out!" Lelldorin shouted, but it was too late. The Mallorean answer to the Asturian arrow storm
                was a storm of their own. From a hundred catapults concealed behind the low hills to the north, a great
                cloud of rocks hurtled into the air and crashed down into the close-packed ranks along the riverbank. A
                stone perhaps somewhat larger than a man's head struck Torasin full in the chest, smashing him to the
                ground.
            </p>
            <p>"Tor!" Lelldorin's cry was anguished as he ran to his stricken cousin. Torasin's eyes were closed, and
                blood was flowing from his nose. His chest was crushed.
            </p>
            <p>"Help me!" Lelldorin cried to a group of serfs standing nearby. The serfs obediently moved to assist him,
                but their eyes, speaking louder than any words, said that Torasin was already dead.
            </p>
            <p>Barak's face was bleak as he stood at the tiller of his big ship. His oarsmen stroked to the beat of a
                muffled drum, and the ship raced downriver.
            </p>
            <p>King Anheg of Cherek lounged against the rail. He had pulled off his helmet so that the cool river air
                could blow the stink of smoke out of his hair. His coarse-featured face was as grim as his cousin's.
                "What do you think their chances are?" he asked.
            </p>
            <p>"Not very good," Barak replied bluntly. "We never counted on the Murgos and Malloreans hitting us at
                Thull Mardu. The army's split in two by the river, and both halves of it are outnumbered. They're going
                to have a bad time of it, I'm afraid." He glanced over his shoulder at the half dozen small,
                narrow-beamed boats trailing in the wake of his big ship. "Close it up!" he bellowed at the men in the
                smaller boats.
            </p>
            <p>"Malloreans ahead! On the north bank!" the lookout at the mast shouted. "About a half a mile!"</p>
            <p>"Wet down the decks," Barak ordered.</p>
            <p>The sailors tossed buckets on long ropes over the side, hauled up water, and soaked the wooden decks.</p>
            <p>"Signal the ships behind us," Anheg told the bearded sailor standing in the very stern of the ship. The
                sailor nodded, turned and lifted a large flag attached to a long pole. He began to wave it vigorously at
                the ships strung out behind them.
            </p>
            <p>"Be careful with that fire!" Barak shouted to the men clustered around a raised platform filled with
                gravel and covered with glowing coals. "If you set us ablaze, you'll all have to swim to the Sea of the
                East."
            </p>
            <p>Just to the front of the platform stood three heavy-limbed catapults, cocked and ready.</p>
            <p>King Anheg squinted ahead at the Malloreans gathered around a dozen or so siege engines standing solidly
                on the north bank. "Better send in your arrowboats now," he suggested.
            </p>
            <p>Barak grunted and waved his arm in a broad chopping motion to the six narrow boats in his wake. In
                answer, the lean little boats leaped ahead, cutting through the water. Mounted at the prow of each
                arrowboat stood a long-armed catapult armed with a loosely packed bundle of arrows. Aided by the
                current, the narrow little boats sped past, their oars bending.
            </p>
            <p>"Load the engines!" Barak roared to the men around the gravelbased fire. "And don't slop any of that tar
                on my decks."
            </p>
            <p>With long iron hooks, the sailors lifted three large earthenware pots out of the coals. The pots
                contained a seething mixture of tar, pitch, and naptha. They were quickly dipped in tar barrels and then
                hastily wrapped in naptha-soaked rags. Then they were placed in the baskets of the waiting engines.
            </p>
            <p>As the arrowboats, speeding like greyhounds, swept in close to shore where the Malloreans struggled to
                aim their catapults, the arrow-bundles were suddenly hurled high into the air by the lashing arms of the
                Cherek engines. The arrows rose swiftly, then slowed at the top of their arching flight, separating and
                spreading out as they flew. Then, in a deadly rain, they fell upon the red-tunicked Malloreans.
            </p>
            <p>Barak's ship, trailing just behind the arrowboats, ran in close to the brush-covered riverbank, and the
                red-bearded man stood with both of his big hands on the tiller, staring intently at his catapult master,
                a gray-bearded old sailor with arms like oak stumps. The catapult master was squinting at a line of
                notches chipped into the railing in front of his engines. Over his head he held a long white baton and
                he indicated direction by pointing it either to the right or the left. Barak moved his tiller delicately
                in response to the movements of the baton. Then the baton cut sharply straight down, and Barak locked
                his tiller in an iron grip. The rags wrapped around the pots leaped into flame as they were touched by
                waiting torches.
            </p>
            <p>"Shoot!" the catapult master barked. With a thudding crash, the beams lashed forward, hurling the flaming
                pots and their deadly contents in a high arch toward the struggling Malloreans and their siege engines.
                The pots burst open upon impact, spraying fire in front of them. The Mallorean catapults were engulfed
                in flame.
            </p>
            <p>"Good shooting," Anheg noted professionally.</p>
            <p>"Child's play," Barak shrugged. "A shoreline emplacement isn't much of a challenge, really." He glanced
                back. The arrowboats of Greldik's ship were sweeping in to rake the Malloreans with more arrows, and the
                catapults on his bearded friend's decks were cocked and loaded. "Malloreans don't appear to be any
                brighter than Murgos. Didn't it ever occur to them that we might shoot back?"
            </p>
            <p>"It's an Angarak failing," Anheg replied. "It shows up in all their writings. Torak never encouraged
                creative thinking."
            </p>
            <p>Barak gave his cousin a speculative look. "You know what I think, Anheg? I think that all that fuss you
                raised back at Riva - about Ce'Nedra leading the army, I mean - I think that it wasn't entirely sincere.
            </p>
            <p>You're too intelligent to be so stubborn about something that wasn't that important."</p>
            <p>Anheg winked broadly.</p>
            <p>"No wonder they call you Anheg the sly," Barak chuckled. "What was it all about?"</p>
            <p>"It pulled Brand's teeth." The King of Cherek grinned. "He's the one who could have stopped Ce'Nedra cold
                if I'd given him the chance. Rivans are very conservative, Barak. I sided with Brand and did all the
                talking.
            </p>
            <p>Then when I gave in, he didn't have any ground left to stand on.</p>
            <p>"You were very convincing. I thought for a while that your reason had slipped."</p>
            <p>"Thank you," the Cherek King replied with a mock bow. "When you've got a face like mine, it's easy for
                people to think the worst about you. I've found that useful from time to time. Here come the Algars." He
                pointed at the hills just behind the burning Mallorean siege engines. A great crowd of horsemen came
                surging over the hilltops to sweep down like a wolf pack upon the confounded Malloreans.
            </p>
            <p>Anheg sighed then. "I'd like to know what's happening to them back there at Thull Mardu," he said. "I
                don't suppose we'll ever find out, though."
            </p>
            <p>"Not very likely," Barak agreed. "We'll all get sunk eventually, once we get out into the Sea of the
                East."
            </p>
            <p>"We'll take a lot of Malloreans with us, though, won't we, Barak?"</p>
            <p>Barak's reply was an evil grin.</p>
            <p>"I don't really care much for the notion of drowning," Anheg said, making a face.</p>
            <p>"Maybe you'll get lucky and catch an arrow in the belly."</p>
            <p>"Thanks," Anheg said sourly.</p>
            <p>An hour or so later, after three more Angarak positions on the riverbanks had been destroyed, the land
                along the River Mardu turned marshy, flattening out into a sea of reeds and bending cattails. At Anheg's
                orders, a raft piled high with firewood was moored to a dead snag and set afire. Once the blaze was
                going well, buckets of greenish crystals were hurled into the flames. A thick pillar of green smoke
                began to climb into the blue sky.
            </p>
            <p>"I hope Rhodar can see that." The King of Cherek frowned.</p>
            <p>"If he can't, the Algars will," Barak replied. "They'll get word back to him."</p>
            <p>"I just hope he's got enough time left to make his retreat."</p>
            <p>"Me too," Barak said. "But as you say, we'll probably never know."</p>
            <p>King Cho-Hag, Chief of the Clan-Chiefs of Algaria, sat his horse beside King Korodullin of Arendia. The
                fog was nearly gone now, and only a filmy haze remained. Not far away, the twin sorcerers, Beltira and
                Belkira, exhausted by their efforts, sat side by side on the ground, their heads bowed and their chests
                heaving. Cho-Hag shuddered inwardly at the thought of what might have happened if the two saintly old
                men had not been there. The hideous illusions of the Grolims that had risen from the earth just before
                the storm had struck terror into the hearts of the bravest warriors. Then the storm, its intensity
                deafening, had smashed down on the army, and after that had come the choking fog. The two sweet-faced
                sorcerers, however, had met and overcome each Grolim attack with calm determination. Now the Murgos were
                coming, and it was time for steel instead of sorcery.
            </p>
            <p>"I'd let them get a little closer," Cho-Hag advised in his quiet voice as he and Korodullin watched the
                veritable sea of Murgos advancing against the emplaced ranks of Drasnian pikemen and Tolnedran
                legionnaires.
            </p>
            <p>"Art thou sure of thy strategy, Cho-Hag?" the young Arendish King asked with a worried frown. "It hath
                ever been the custom of the knights of Mimbre to meet an attack head-on. Thy proposal to charge the
                flanks puzzles me."
            </p>
            <p>"It will kill more Murgos, Korodullin," Cho-Hag replied, shifting his weak legs in their stirrups. "When
                your knights charge in from either flank, you'll cut off whole regiments of the enemy. Then we can grind
                the ones who've been cut off up against the infantry."
            </p>
            <p>"It is passing strange to me to work thus with foot troops," Korodullin confessed. "I have a vast
                ignorance of unmounted combat."
            </p>
            <p>"You aren't alone, my friend," Cho-Hag told him. "It's as alien to me as it is to you. It would be unfair
                of us, though, not to let the foot troops have a few Murgos, wouldn't it? They did walk a long way,
                after all."
            </p>
            <p>The King of Arendia considered that gravely. He was quite obviously incapable of anything remotely
                resembling humor. "I had not considered that," he confessed. "'Twould be selfish in the extreme of us to
                deny them some part in the battle, I must agree. How many Murgos dost thou think would be their fair
                portion?"
            </p>
            <p>"Oh, I don't know," Cho-Hag replied with a straight face. "A few thousand or so, I imagine. We wouldn't
                want to appear stingy - but it doesn't do to be over generous, either."
            </p>
            <p>Korodullin sighed. "It is a difficult line to walk, King Cho-Hag - this fine division between parsimony
                and foolish prodigality."
            </p>
            <p>"One of the prices of kingship, Korodullin."</p>
            <p>"Very true, Cho-Hag, very true." The young King of Arendia sighed again and bent all his concentration to
                the problem of how many of the advancing Murgos he could really afford to give away. "Thinkest thou that
                two Murgos apiece might content those who fight afoot?" he asked rather hesitantly.
            </p>
            <p>"Sounds fair to me."</p>
            <p>Korodullin smiled then with happy relief. "Then that is what we shall allot them," he declared. "I have
                not divided up Murgos before, but it is not nearly so difficult as I had imagined."
            </p>
            <p>King Cho-Hag began to laugh.</p>
            <p>Lady Ariana put her arms about Lelldorin's shaking shoulders and drew him gently away from the pallet
                upon which his cousin's body lay.
            </p>
            <p>"Can't you do something, Ariana?" he pleaded, tears streaming down his face. "Perhaps a bandage of some
                sort-and a poultice."
            </p>
            <p>"He is beyond my art, my Lord," Ariana replied gently, "and I share thy sorrow at his death."</p>
            <p>"Don't say that word, Ariana. Torasin can't be dead."</p>
            <p>"I'm sorry, my Lord," she said simply. "He is gone, and none of my remedies or skill can bring him
                back."
            </p>
            <p>"Polgara can do it," Lelldorin declared suddenly, an impossible hope leaping into his eyes. "Send for
                Polgara."
            </p>
            <p>"I have no one to send, my Lord," Ariana told him, looking around the makeshift tent where she and Taiba
                and a few others were caring for the wounded. "The injured men here command all our attention and care."
            </p>
            <p>"I'll go then," Lelldorin declared, his eyes still streaming tears. He spun and dashed from the tent.</p>
            <p>Ariana sighed mournfully and drew a blanket over Torasin's pale face. Then she turned back to the wounded
                men who were being carried in a steady stream into her tent.
            </p>
            <p>"Don't bother yourself with him, my Lady," a leanfaced Arendish serf told her as she bent over the body
                of the man's companion. Ariana looked at the thin serf inquiringly.
            </p>
            <p>"He's dead," the serf explained. "He took a Mallorean arrow right through the chest." He looked down at
                the dead man's face. "Poor Detton," he sighed. "He died in my arms. Do you know what his last words
                were?"
            </p>
            <p>Ariana shook her head.</p>
            <p>"He said, 'At least I had a good breakfast.' And then he died."</p>
            <p>"Why didst thou bring him here, since thou didst know he was already dead?" Ariana asked him gently.</p>
            <p>The lean, bitter-faced serf shrugged. "I didn't want to leave him just lying in a muddy ditch like a dead
                dog," he replied. "In his whole life, nobody ever treated him as if he mattered at all. He was my
                friend, and I didn't want to leave him there like a pile of garbage." He laughed a short, bitter laugh.
                "I don't suppose it matters very much to him, but at least there's a little bit of dignity here." He
                awkwardly patted the dead man's shoulder. "Sorry, Detton," he said, "but I guess I'd better go back to
                the fighting."
            </p>
            <p>"What is thy name, friend?" Ariana asked.</p>
            <p>"I'm called Lammer, my Lady."</p>
            <p>"Is the need for thee in the battle urgent?"</p>
            <p>"I doubt it, my Lady. I've been shooting arrows at the Malloreans. I'm not very good at it, but it's what
                I'm supposed to do."
            </p>
            <p>"My need for thee is greater, then," she declared. "I have many wounded here and few hands to help with
                their care. Despite thy surly exterior, I sense a great compassion in thee. Wilt thou help me?"
            </p>
            <p>He regarded her for a moment. "What do you want me to do?" he said.</p>
            <p>"Taiba is boiling cloth for bandages over that fire there," she replied. "See to the fire first, then
                thou wilt find a cart just outside with blankets in it. Bring in the blankets, good Lammer. After that I
                will have other tasks for thee."
            </p>
            <p>"All right," Lammer replied laconically, moving toward the fire.</p>
            <p>"What can we do for her?" the Princess Ce'Nedra demanded of the misshapen Beldin. The princess was
                staring intently into Polgara's pale, unconscious face as the sorceress lay exhausted in the arms of
                Durnik the smith.
            </p>
            <p>"Let her sleep," Beldin grunted. "She'll be all right in a day or so."</p>
            <p>"What's the matter with her?" Durnik asked in a worried voice.</p>
            <p>"She's exhausted," Beldin snapped. "Isn't that obvious?"</p>
            <p>"Just from raising a breeze? I've seen her do things that looked a lot harder."</p>
            <p>"You don't have the faintest idea of what you're talking about, blacksmith," Beldin growled. The
                hunchbacked sorcerer was himself pale and shaking. "When you start tampering with the weather, you're
                putting your hands on the most powerful forces in the world. I'd rather try to stop a tide or uproot a
                mountain than stir up a breeze in dead air."
            </p>
            <p>"The Grolims brought in that storm," Durnik said.</p>
            <p>"The air was already moving. Deadcalm air is altogether different. Do you have the remotest idea of how
                much air you've got to move to stir even the faintest breath of air? Do you know what kind of pressures
                are involved - how much all that air weighs?"
            </p>
            <p>"Air doesn't weigh anything," Ce'Nedra protested.</p>
            <p>"Really?" Beldin replied with heavy sarcasm. "I'm so glad you told me. Would the two of you shut up and
                let me get my breath?"
            </p>
            <p>"But how is it that she collapsed and you didn't?" Ce'Nedra protested.</p>
            <p>"I'm stronger than she is," Beldin replied, "and more vicious. Pol throws her whole heart into things
                when she gets excited. She always did. She pushed beyond her strength, and it exhausted her." The
                twisted little man straightened, shook himself like a dog coming out of water and looked around, his
                face bleak. "I've got work to do," he said. "I think we've pretty much worn out the Mallorean Grolims,
                but I'd better keep an eye on them, just to be safe. You two stay here with Pol - and keep an eye on
                that child." He pointed at Errand, who stood on the sandy beach with his small face very serious.
            </p>
            <p>Then Beldin crouched, shimmering already into the form of a hawk, and launched himself into the air
                almost before his feathers were fully formed.
            </p>
            <p>Ce'Nedra stared after him as he spiraled upward over the battlefield and then turned her attention back
                to the unconscious Polgara.
            </p>
            <p>The charge of Korodullin's Mimbrate knights came at the last possible moment. Like two great scythes, the
                armored men on their massive chargers sliced in at a thundering gallop from the flanks with their lances
                leveled and cut through the horde of Murgos rushing toward the waiting pikemen and legionnaires. The
                results were devastating. The air was filled with screams and the sounds of steel striking steel with
                stunning impact. In the wake of the charge lay a path of slaughtered Murgos, a trail of human wreckage a
                hundred yards wide.
            </p>
            <p>King Cho-Hag, sitting on his horse on a hilltop some distance to the west, nodded his approval as he
                watched the carnage. "Good," he said finally. He looked around at the eager faces of the Algar clansmen
                clustered around him. "All right, my children," he said calmly, "let's go cut up the Murgo reserves."
                And he led them at a gallop as they poured down off the hill, smoothly swung around the outer flanks of
                the tightly packed assault forces and then slashed into the unprepared Murgo units bringing up the rear.
            </p>
            <p>The slash-and-run tactics of the clans of the Algars left heaps of sabred dead in their wake as they
                darted in and out of the milling confusion of terrified Murgos. King Cho-Hag himself led several
                charges, and his skill with the sabre, which was legendary in Algaria, filled his followers with an awed
                pride as they watched his whiplike blows raining down on Murgo heads and shoulders. The whole thrust of
                Algar strategy was based on speed - a sudden dash on a fast horse and a series of lightninglike sabre
                slashes, and then out before the enemy could gather his wits. King Cho-Hag's sabre arm was the fastest
                in Algaria.
            </p>
            <p>"My King!" one of his men shouted, pointing toward the center of several close-packed Murgo regiments
                milling about in a shallow valley a few hundred yards away. "There's the black banner!"
            </p>
            <p>King Cho-Hag's eyes suddenly gleamed as a wild hope surged through him. "Bring my banner to the front!"
                he roared, and the clansman who carried the burgundy-and-white banner of the Chief of the Clan-Chiefs
                galloped forward with the standard streaming above his head. "Let's go, my children!" Cho-Hag shouted
                and drove his horse directly at the Murgos in the valley. With sabre raised, the crippled King of the
                Algars led his men down into the Murgo horde. His warriors slashed to the right and to the left, but
                ChoHag plunged directly at the center, his eyes feed on the black banner of Taur Urgas, King of the
                Murgos.
            </p>
            <p>And then, in the midst of the household guard, Cho-Hag saw the blood-red mail of Taur Urgas himself.</p>
            <p>Cho-Hag raised his bloody sabre and shouted a ringing challenge.</p>
            <p>"Stand and fight, you Murgo dog!" he roared.</p>
            <p>Startled by that shout, Taur Urgas wheeled his horse to stare incredulously at the charging King of
                Algaria.
            </p>
            <p>His eyes suddenly bulged with the fervid light of insanity, and his lips, foam-flacked, drew back in a
                snarl of hatred. "Let him come!" he grated. "Clear the way for himl"
            </p>
            <p>The startled members of his personal guard stared at him.</p>
            <p>"Make way for the King of Algaria!" Taur Urgas shrieked. "He is mine!"</p>
            <p>And the Murgo troops melted out of Cho-Hag's path.</p>
            <p>The Algar King reined in his horse. "And so it's finally come, Taur Urgas," he said coldly.</p>
            <p>"It has indeed, Cho-Hag," Taur Urgas replied. "I've waited for this moment for years."</p>
            <p>"If I'd known you were waiting, I'd have come sooner."</p>
            <p>"Today is your last day, Cho-Hag." The Murgo King's eyes were completely mad now, and foam drooled from
                the corners of his mouth.
            </p>
            <p>"Do you plan to fight with threats and hollow words, Taur Urgas? Or have you forgotten how to draw your
                sword?"
            </p>
            <p>With an insane shriek, Taur Urgas ripped his broad-bladed sword from its scabbard and drove his black
                horse toward the Algar King.
            </p>
            <p>"Die!" he howled, slashing at the air even as he charged. "Die, ChoHag!"</p>
            <p>It was not a duel, for there were proprieties in a duel. The two kings hacked at each other with an
                elemental brutality, thousands of years of pent-up hatred boiling in their blood. Taur Urgas, totally
                mad now, sobbed and gibbered as he swung his heavy sword at his enemy. ChoHag, cold as ice and with an
                arm as fast as the flickering tongue of a snake, slid the crushing Murgo blows aside, catching them on
                his sliding sabre and flicking his blade like a whip, its edge biting again and again into the shoulders
                and face of the King of the Murgos.
            </p>
            <p>The two armies, stunned by the savagery of the encounter, recoiled and gave the mounted kings room for
                their deadly struggle.
            </p>
            <p>Frothing obscenities, Taur Urgas hacked insanely at the elusive form of his foe, but Cho-Hag, colder yet,
                feinted and parried and flicked his whistling sabre at the Murgo's bleeding face.
            </p>
            <p>Finally, driven past even what few traces of reason were left to him, Taur Urgas hurled his horse
                directly at Cho-Hag with a wild animal scream. Standing in his stirrups, he grasped his sword hilt in
                both hands, raising it like an axe to smash his enemy forever. But Cho-Hag danced his horse to one side
                and thrust with all his strength, even as Taur Urgas began his massive blow. With a steely rasp, his
                sabre ran through the Murgo's blood-red mail and through the tensed body, to emerge dripping from his
                back.
            </p>
            <p>Unaware in his madness that he had just received a mortal wound, Taur Urgas raised his sword again, but
                the strength drained from his arms and the sword fell from his grasp. With stunned disbelief, he gaped
                at the sabre emerging from his chest, and a bloody froth burst from his mouth. He lifted his hands like
                claws as if to tear away the face of his enemy, but Cho-Hag contemptuously slapped his hands away, even
                as he pulled his slender, curved blade out of the Murgo's body with a slithering whistle.
            </p>
            <p>"And so it ends, Taur Urgas," he declared in an icy voice.</p>
            <p>"No!" Taur Urgas croaked, trying to pull a heavy dagger from his belt.</p>
            <p>Cho-Hag watched his feeble efforts coldly. Dark blood suddenly spurted from the open mouth of the Murgo
                King, and he toppled weakly from his saddle. Struggling, coughing blood, Taur Urgas lurched to his feet,
                gurgling curses at the man who had just killed him.
            </p>
            <p>"Good fight, though," Cho-Hag told him with a bleak smile, and then he turned to ride away.</p>
            <p>Taur Urgas fell, clawing at the turf in impotent rage. "Come back and fight," he sobbed. "Come back."</p>
            <p>Cho-Hag glanced over his shoulder. "Sorry, your Majesty," he replied, "but I have pressing business
                elsewhere. I'm sure you understand." And with that he began to ride away.
            </p>
            <p>"Come back!" Taur Urgas wailed, belching blood and curses and digging his fingers into the earth. "Come
                back!" Then he collapsed facedown in the bloody grass. "Come back and fight, Cho-Hag!" he gasped weakly.
            </p>
            <p>The last that Cho-Hag saw of him, the dying King of Cthol Murgos was biting at the sod and clawing at the
                earth with trembling fingers. A vast moan shuddered through the tight-packed regiments of the Murgos,
                and a sudden cheer rose from the ranks of the Algars as ChoHag, victorious, rode back to join the army.
            </p>
            <p>"They're coming again," General Varana announced with cool professionalism as he watched the waves of
                oncoming Malloreans.
            </p>
            <p>"Where is that signal?" Rhodar demanded, staring intently downriver. "What's Anheg doing down there?"</p>
            <p>The front ranks of the Mallorean assault struck with a resounding crash. The Drasnian pikemen began to
                thrust with their long, widebladed spears, wreaking havoc among the red-garbed attackers, and the
                legions raised their shields in the interlocked position that presented a solid wall against which the
                Malloreans beat futilely. Upon a sharp, barked command, the legionnaires turned their shields slightly
                and each man thrust his lance out through the opening between his shield and the next. The Tolnedran
                lances were not as long as the Drasnian pikes, but they were long enough. A huge, shuddering cry went
                through the front ranks of the Malloreans, and they fell in heaps beneath the feet of the men behind.
            </p>
            <p>"Are they going to break through?" Rhodar puffed. Even though he was not directly involved in the
                fighting, the Drasnian King began to pant at each Mallorean charge.
            </p>
            <p>Varana carefully assessed the strength of the assault. "No," he concluded, "not this time. Have you
                worked out how you're going to make your withdrawal? It's a little difficult to pull back when your
                troops are engaged."
            </p>
            <p>"That's why I'm saving the Mimbrates," Rhodar replied. "They're resting their horses now for one last
                charge. As soon as we get the signal from Anheg, Mandorallen and his men will shove the Malloreans back,
                and the rest of us will run like rabbits."
            </p>
            <p>"The charge will only hold them back for so long," Varana advised, "and then they'll come after you
                again."
            </p>
            <p>"We'll form up again upriver a ways," Rhodar said.</p>
            <p>"It's going to take a long time to get back to the escarpment if you're going to have to stop and fight
                every half mile or so," Varana told him.
            </p>
            <p>"I know that," Rhodar snapped peevishly. "Have you got any better ideas?"</p>
            <p>"No," Varana replied. "I was just pointing it out, that's all."</p>
            <p>"Where is that signal?" Rhodar demanded again.</p>
            <p>On a quiet hillside some distance from the struggle taking place on the north bank, the simpleminded serf
                boy from the Arendish forest was playing his flute. His melody was mournful, but even in its sadness, it
                soared to the sky. The boy did not understand the fighting and he had wandered away unnoticed. Now he
                sat alone on the grassy hillside in the warm, midmorning sunlight with his entire soul pouring out of
                his flute.
            </p>
            <p>The Mallorean soldier who was creeping up behind him with drawn sword had no ear for music. He did not
                know - or care - that the song the boy played was the most beautiful song any man had ever heard.
            </p>
            <p>The song ended very suddenly, never to begin again.</p>
            <p>The stream of casualties being carried to Ariana's makeshift hospital grew heavier, and the overtaxed
                Mimbrate girl was soon forced into making some cruel decisions. Only those men with some chance of
                survival could be treated. The mortally hurt were quickly given a drink of a bitter-tasting potion of
                herbs that would ease their pain and then were left to die. Each such decision wrung Ariana's heart, and
                she worked with tears standing in her eyes.
            </p>
            <p>And then Brand, the Rivan Warder, entered the tent with a stricken face. The big Rivan's mail shirt was
                blood-spattered, and there were savage sword cuts along the edge of his broad, round shield. Behind him,
                three of his sons bore the limp, bleeding form of their younger brother, Olban.
            </p>
            <p>"Can you see to him?" Brand asked Ariana hoarsely.</p>
            <p>A single glance, however, told the blond girl that the wound in Olban's chest was mortal. "I can make him
                comfortable," she replied a bit evasively. She quickly knelt beside the bleeding young man, lifted his
                head, and held a cup to his lips.
            </p>
            <p>"Father," Olban said weakly after he had drunk, "I have something I have to tell you."</p>
            <p>"Time enough for that later," Brand told him gruffly, "after you're better."</p>
            <p>"I'm not going to get better, father," Olban said in a voice scarcely more than a whisper.</p>
            <p>"Nonsense," Brand told him, but there was no conviction in his voice.</p>
            <p>"There's not much time, father," Olban said, coughing weakly. "Please listen."</p>
            <p>"Very well, Olban," the Warder said, leaning forward to catch his son's words.</p>
            <p>"At Riva - after Belgarion came - I was humiliated because you had been deposed. I couldn't bear it,
                father." Olban coughed again, and a bloody froth came to his lips.
            </p>
            <p>"You should have known me better than that, Olban," Brand said gently.</p>
            <p>"I do - now." Olban sighed. "But I was young and proud, and Belgarion - a nobody from Sendaria - had
                pushed you from your rightful place."
            </p>
            <p>"It wasn't my place to begin with, Olban," Brand told him. "It was his. Belgarion's the Rivan King. That
                has nothing to do with position or place. It's a duty - and it's his, not mine."
            </p>
            <p>"I hated him," Olban whispered. "I began to follow him every place. Wherever he went, I wasn't far behind
                him."
            </p>
            <p>"What for?" Brand asked.</p>
            <p>"At first I didn't know. Then one day he came out of the throne room wearing his robe and crown. He
                seemed so puffed-up with his own importance - as if he really was a king instead of just a common
                Sendarian scullion. Then I knew what I had to do. I took my dagger and I threw it at his back."
            </p>
            <p>Brand's face suddenly froze.</p>
            <p>"For a long time after that, I tried to avoid him," Olban continued. "I knew that what I had done was
                wrong
            </p>
            <p>- even as the dagger left my fingers. I thought that if I stayed away from him, he'd never find out that
                I was the one who'd tried to kill him. But he has powers, father. He has ways of knowing things no man
                could possibly know. He sought me out one day and gave me back the dagger I'd thrown at him and he told
                me that I should never tell anyone what I'd done. He did that for you, father - to keep my disgrace from
                you."
            </p>
            <p>Grim-faced, Brand rose to his feet. "Come," he said to his other three sons. "We have fighting to do -
                and no time to waste on traitors." Quite deliberately he turned his back on his dying son.
            </p>
            <p>"I tried to repay his mercy, father," Olban pleaded. "I pledged my life to protecting his queen. Doesn't
                that count for anything?" Brand's face was stony, and he kept his back turned in grim silence.
                "Belgarion forgave me, father. Can't you find it in your heart to forgive me too?"
            </p>
            <p>"No," Brand said harshly, "I cannot."</p>
            <p>"Please, father," Olban begged. "Don't you have one tear for me?"</p>
            <p>"Not one," Brand told him, but Ariana saw that his words were a lie. The grim, gray-clad man's eyes were
                full, but his face remained granitelike. Without another word, he strode from the tent.
            </p>
            <p>Wordlessly, each of Olban's brothers clasped his hand in turn, and then they left to follow their
                father.
            </p>
            <p>Olban wept quietly for a time, but then his growing weakness and the drug Ariana had given him drained
                away his grief. He lay, half dozing on his pallet for a time, then struggled to raise himself and
                beckoned to the Mimbrate girl. She knelt beside him, supporting him with one arm about his shoulders and
                her head bent to catch his faltering words. "Please," he whispered. "Please tell her Majesty what I said
                to my father -
            </p>
            <p>and tell her how sorry I was." And then his head fell forward against Ariana, and he quietly died in her
                arms.
            </p>
            <p>Ariana had no time to mourn, for precisely then three Sendars carried Colonel Brendig into her tent. The
                colonel's left arm was mangled beyond all hope of repair.
            </p>
            <p>"We were bringing down the bridge that crosses to the city," one of the Sendars reported tersely. "There
                was a support that wouldn't give way, so the colonel went down himself to chop it away. When it finally
                broke, the timbers of the bridge fell on him."
            </p>
            <p>Ariana gravely examined Brendig's shattered arm. "I fear there is no recourse, my Lord," she told him.
                "The arm will have to come off, lest it mortify and carry thy life away with it."
            </p>
            <p>Brendig nodded soberly. "That's about what I'd expected," he replied. "I suppose we'd better get on with
                it then."
            </p>
            <p>"There!" King Rhodar shouted, pointing downriver. "The smoke - it's green! That's the signal. We can
                start the retreat now."
            </p>
            <p>General Varana, however, was staring at the riverbank upstream. "It's too late, I'm afraid, your
                Majesty," he said quietly. "A column of Malloreans and Nadraks have just reached the river to the west
                of us. It very much looks as if we've been cut off."
            </p>
        </chapter>
        <chapter number="18">
            <p>THE NEWS OF the death of Taur Urgas spread through the Murgo army in a vast groan, and the heart went out
                of the black-robed troops. Taur Urgas had been feared by his men, but his savage madness had lent them
                all a peculiar sense that they were invincible. They had felt somehow that nothing could stand in his
                path, and that they, as the instruments of his brutal will, shared in some measure his apparent
                invulnerability. But with his death, each Murgo became aware with a sudden cold touch of fear that he
                also could die, and the assault on the armies of the west along the south bank faltered.
            </p>
            <p>King Cho-Hag watched the crumbling of the Murgo resolve with a certain grim satisfaction, then rode down
                to the lines of infantry and the milling Mimbrate knights to confer with the other leaders. King Fulrach
                strode forward from the ranks of his Sendars. The dumpy, brown-bearded monarch looked almost comical in
                his burnished breastplate, but his sword showed signs of recent use, and his helmet was dented in a
                couple of places, mute evidence that the King of Sendaria had participated in the fight.
            </p>
            <p>"Have you seen Anheg's signal yet?" Fulrach demanded as he approached.</p>
            <p>Cho-Hag shook his head. "It should come any time now, though," he replied. "We'd better make some plans.
                Have you seen Korodullin?"
            </p>
            <p>"The physicians are working on him," Fulrach said.</p>
            <p>"Is he hurt?" Cho-Hag was startled.</p>
            <p>"I don't think it's too serious. He went to help his friend, the Baron of Vo Ebor, and a Murgo hit him in
                the head with a mace. His helmet absorbed most of the blow. He's bleeding out of the ears a bit, but the
                physicians say he'll recover. The baron's in worse shape, though."
            </p>
            <p>"Who's in charge of the Mimbrates, then?"</p>
            <p>"Sir Andorig. He's a good man in a fight, but his understanding is a bit limited."</p>
            <p>Cho-Hag laughed shortly. "You've just described most of Arendia, my friend. They're all good in a fight,
                and they all have limited understanding." Carefully he dismounted, holding onto his saddle as his weak
                legs nearly buckled. "We can make our decisions without Andorig's help, I think." He looked at the
                retreating Murgos. "As soon as we see Anheg's signal, I think we're going to want to get out of here in
                a hurry. The Murgos are demoralized right now, but they'll probably stiffen up again as soon as the
                shock wears off."
            </p>
            <p>Fulrach nodded. "Did you really kill Taur Urgas in a duel?" he asked.</p>
            <p>Cho-Hag nodded. "It wasn't really all that much of a duel. He was raving when he came at me and didn't
                even try to defend himself. When Anheg signals, we'll have the Mimbrates charge the Murgo front. The
                Murgos will probably break and run. I'll follow after them with my clansmen to hurry them along. That
                should give you and your foot troops time to start upriver. Andorig and I'll keep the Murgos off your
                back until you get clear. How does that sound?"
            </p>
            <p>King Fulrach nodded. "It sounds workable," he agreed. "Do you think they'll try to follow us?"</p>
            <p>Cho-Hag grinned. "I'll encourage them not to," he replied. "Have you got any idea of what's going on
                across the river?"
            </p>
            <p>"It's hard to say, but things don't look very good."</p>
            <p>"Can you think of any way we can send them help?"</p>
            <p>"Not on short notice," Fulrach answered.</p>
            <p>"Neither can I," Cho-Hag said. He began to pull himself back up into his saddle. "I'll go give Andorig
                his instructions. Keep your eyes open for Anheg's signal."
            </p>
            <p>"Belgarath!" Ce'Nedra called out silently, her hand tightly clasped about the amulet at her throat.</p>
            <p>"Belgarath, can you hear me?" She was standing several yards away from where Durnik was trying to make
                the unconscious Polgara as comfortable as possible. The princess had her eyes tightly closed and she was
                putting every ounce of concentration into casting her thought to the sky, reaching out with all her
                heart toward the ancient sorcerer.
            </p>
            <p>"Ce'Nedra?" The old man's voice was as clear as if he were standing beside her. "What are you doing?</p>
            <p>Where's Polgara?"</p>
            <p>"Oh, Belgarath!" The princess almost sobbed with relief. "Help us. Lady Polgara's unconscious, and the
                Malloreans are attacking again. We're being slaughtered, Belgarath. Help us."
            </p>
            <p>"Slow down," he commanded brusquely. "What happened to Pol? Where are you?"</p>
            <p>"We're at Thull Mardu," Ce'Nedra replied. "We had to take the city so that the Cherek fleet could go on
                down the river. The Malloreans and the Murgos crept up on us. They've been attacking since early this
                morning."
            </p>
            <p>Belgarath started to swear. "What's wrong with Pol?" he demanded harshly.</p>
            <p>"The Grolims brought in an awful storm, and then there was fog. Lady Polgara and Beldin made the wind
                blow, and then she just collapsed. Beldin said that she exhausted herself and that we have to let her
                sleep."
            </p>
            <p>"Where's Beldin?"</p>
            <p>"He said that he had to keep an eye on the Grolims. Can you help us?"</p>
            <p>"Ce'Nedra, I'm a thousand leagues away from you. Garion, Silk, and I are in Mallorea - practically on
                Torak's doorstep. If I so much as raise my hand, it will wake him, and Garion's not ready to meet him
                yet."
            </p>
            <p>"We're doomed, then," Ce'Nedra wailed.</p>
            <p>"Stop that," he snapped. "This isn't the time for hysterics. You're going to have to wake Polgara."</p>
            <p>"We've tried - and Beldin says that we've got to let her rest."</p>
            <p>"She can rest later," Belgarath retorted. "Is that bag she always carries somewhere about - the one she
                keeps all those herbs in?"
            </p>
            <p>"I - I think so. Durnik was carrying it a little while ago."</p>
            <p>"Durnik's with you? Good. Now listen, and listen carefully. Get the bag and open it. What you want will
                be in a silk pouch. Don't open any jars or bottles. She keeps her poisons in those. In one of the silk
                bags you'll
            </p>
            <p>find a yellow-colored powder. It has a very acrid odor to it. Put a spoonful or so of that powder into a
                pot of boiling water. Put the pot beside Pol's head and cover her face with a cloak so she has to
                breathe the fumes."
            </p>
            <p>"What will that do?"</p>
            <p>"It will wake her up."</p>
            <p>"Are you sure?"</p>
            <p>"Don't argue with me, Ce'Nedra. She'll wake up, believe me. Those fumes would wake up a dead stick. As
                soon as she's awake, she'll know what to do."
            </p>
            <p>Ce'Nedra hesitated. "Is Garion there?" she blurted finally.</p>
            <p>"He's asleep. We had a rough time last night."</p>
            <p>"When he wakes up, tell him that I love him." She said it very fast, as if afraid that if she thought
                about it at all, she wouldn't be able to say it.
            </p>
            <p>"Why confuse him?" the old man asked her.</p>
            <p>"Belgarath!" Ce'Nedra's voice was stricken.</p>
            <p>"I was teasing. I'll tell him. Now get to work - and don't do this any more. I'm trying to sneak up on
                Torak, and it's a little hard to sneak when you're shouting at somebody a thousand leagues away."
            </p>
            <p>"We aren't shouting."</p>
            <p>"Oh yes we are - it's a special kind of shouting, but it's shouting all the same. Now take your hand off
                that amulet and get to work." And then his voice was gone.
            </p>
            <p>Durnik, of course, would never understand, so Ce'Nedra did what was necessary by herself. She rummaged
                around until she found a small pot. She filled it with water and set it on the small fire the smith had
                built the night before. Then she opened Polgara's herb bag. The blond child, Errand, stood at her side,
                watching her curiously.
            </p>
            <p>"What are you doing, Princess?" Durnik asked, still hovering anxiously over the sleeping Polgara.</p>
            <p>"I'm fixing something to make her rest easier," Ce'Nedra lied.</p>
            <p>"Are you sure you know what you're doing? Some of those are very dangerous."</p>
            <p>"I know which one I'm looking for," she replied. "Trust me, Durnik."</p>
            <p>The powder she finally located was so acrid that it made her eyes water. She carefully measured out a bit
                of it and dumped it into the pot. The steaming fumes were awful, and the princess kept her face averted
                as she carried the pot to where Polgara lay. She set the pot beside the lady's pale, sleeping face and
                then laid a cloak across her. "Give me a stick," the princess said to the smith.
            </p>
            <p>Durnik, his face dubious, handed her a broken-off arrow.</p>
            <p>Ce'Nedra carefully propped up the cloak, making a small tent over the pot and Polgara's face.</p>
            <p>"What now?" Durnik asked.</p>
            <p>"Now we wait," Ce'Nedra told him.</p>
            <p>Then, coming from the direction of the battle, a group of Sendarian soldiers, evidently wounded, appeared
                at the top of the grassy bank surrounding the secluded little beach. Their jerkins all had bloodstains
                on them, and several of the men wore bandages. Unlike most of the wounded who had already passed that
                morning, however, these men still carried their weapons.
            </p>
            <p>Under the tented cloak, Polgara began to cough.</p>
            <p>"What have you done?" Durnik cried, snatching the cloak away.</p>
            <p>"It was necessary," Ce'Nedra replied. "I talked with Belgarath. He told me that I had to wake her up -
                and how to do it."
            </p>
            <p>"You'll hurt her," Durnik accused. With sudden, uncharacteristic anger, he kicked the fuming pot, sending
                it rolling down the beach toward the water's edge.
            </p>
            <p>Polgara's eyelids were fluttering as she continued to cough. When she opened her eyes, however, her look
                was blank, uncomprehending.
            </p>
            <p>"Can you spare us some water?" one of the wounded Sendars asked as the group of men approached.</p>
            <p>"There's a whole river right there," Ce'Nedra replied absently, pointing even as she intently stared into
                Polgara's eyes.
            </p>
            <p>Durnik, however, gave the men a startled look, then suddenly reached for his sword.</p>
            <p>But the men in Sendarian jerkins had jumped down from the bank and were already upon them. It took three
                of them to disarm the powerful smith and to hold his arms.
            </p>
            <p>"You're not Sendars," Durnik exclaimed, struggling with his captors.</p>
            <p>"How clever of you to notice," one of them replied in an accent so guttural that it was almost
                unintelligible.
            </p>
            <p>Another of them drew his sword and stood over the dazed Polgara. "Stop fighting, friend," he told Durnik
                with an ugly smirk, "or I'll kill this woman."
            </p>
            <p>"Who are you?" Ce'Nedra demanded indignantly. "What do you think you're doing?"</p>
            <p>"Actually, we're members of the Imperial Elite Guard," the man with the sword answered urbanely. "And
                we're here, your Highness, to extend to you the invitation of his Imperial Majesty 'Zakath, Emperor of
                Mallorea. His Majesty requests the honor of your presence in his pavilion." His face hardened, and he
                looked at his men. "Bring them," he ordered. "Let's get out of here before someone comes along and
                starts asking questions."
            </p>
            <p>"They're digging in," Hettar reported to King Rhodar, gesturing toward the west and their now-blocked
                escape route. "They've already got a trench-line running from the river for about a half a mile."
            </p>
            <p>"Is there any chance of going around them?" Rhodar asked.</p>
            <p>Hettar shook his head. "That whole flank's seething with Nadraks."</p>
            <p>"We'll have to go through them, then," the King of Drasnia decided. "I can't very well attack trenches
                with cavalry," Hettar pointed out.
            </p>
            <p>"We'll storm them with the infantry units," Rhodar declared. "We'll have a certain advantage. The
                Asturian bows have a longer range than the short ones the Malloreans use. We'll move the archers to the
                front as we advance. They can rake the trenches and then harass the Mallorean archers behind the lines.
                The pikemen will go in first." The sweating fat man looked at General Varana. "Can your legionnaires
                clear the trenches once we open a hole for you?"
            </p>
            <p>Varana nodded. "We train extensively for trench fighting," he replied confidently. "We'll clear the
                trenches."
            </p>
            <p>"We'll bring the wounded with the main force," Rhodar said. "Somebody locate Polgara and the princess.
            </p>
            <p>It's time to leave."</p>
            <p>"What task hast thou for Lord Hettar and me," Mandorallen inquired. The great knight's armor showed a
                number of dents, but he spoke as calmly as if he had not spent the entire morning involved in heavy
                fighting.
            </p>
            <p>"I want you and your knights to hold the rear," Rhodar told him. "Keep that army out there off my
                back."
            </p>
            <p>He turned to Hettar. "And I want you and your clansmen to go to work on the Nadraks. I don't want them to
                come swarming in while we're working in the trenches."
            </p>
            <p>"It's a desperate move, King Rhodar," General Varana said seriously. "Attacking even hasty fortifications
                is always costly, and you're going to do it with another army coming at you from the rear. If your
                attack is beaten back, you'll be caught between two superior forces. They'll grind you to dogmeat right
                on the spot."
            </p>
            <p>"I know," Rhodar admitted glumly, "but our only hope of escape is breaking through those lines that have
                us blocked off. We've got to get back upriver. Tell your men that we have to take those trenches on the
                first charge. Otherwise, we're all going to die right here. All right, gentlemen, good luck."
            </p>
            <p>Once again Mandorallen led his steel-clad knights in their fearsome charge, and once again the attacking
                Malloreans recoiled, driven back by the dreadful shock as the mounted men of Mimbre struck their front
                ranks. This time, however, the pikemen and legionnaires, as soon as they were disengaged from the enemy,
                turned sharply to the left and, at a jingling trot, abandoned their positions to follow the Sendars and
                Asturians who were already withdrawing from the field toward the west.
            </p>
            <p>The delaying action of the Mimbrate knights was costly. Riderless horses galloped wildly about the
                battlefield, quite frequently adding to the havoc by trampling through the Mallorean ranks. Here and
                there among the red tunics that carpeted the field lay the single gleaming form of a fallen knight.
                Again and again the Mimbrates hurled themselves against the advancing red tide, slowing the Malloreans,
                but not quite able to stop them.
            </p>
            <p>"It's going to be tight, your Majesty," General Varana advised as he and King Rhodar rode toward the
                hastily drawn lines blocking their escape. "Even if we break through, the bulk of the Mallorean forces
                are going to be hot on our heels."
            </p>
            <p>"You've got a great talent for the obvious, General," Rhodar replied. "As soon as we get through, we'll
                put the archers at the rear and let the Malloreans march through a rain of arrows. That will hold them
                back."
            </p>
            <p>"Until the archers run out of arrows," Varana added.</p>
            <p>"After we break through, I'll send the Algars on ahead. Fulrach's got whole wagonloads of arrows at the
                rapids."
            </p>
            <p>"Which is two days march ahead."</p>
            <p>"Do you always look at the dark side of things?"</p>
            <p>"Just trying to anticipate, your Majesty."</p>
            <p>"Would you mind anticipating someplace else?"</p>
            <p>The Algars had moved out to the right flank of the retreating army and were gathering in their
                characteristic small bands, preparing to charge the Nadraks drawn up on the hills above the river.
                Hettar, his scalp lock streaming, moved forward at a steady lope, his sabre drawn and his eyes like
                flint. The Nadraks appeared at first to be awaiting his charge, but then, amazingly, they turned away
                and rode rapidly toward the river.
            </p>
            <p>From the midst of that sudden surge, a half dozen men riding under the Nadrak banner swerved out toward
                the advancing Algars. One of the riders was waving a short stick with a white rag tied to it. The group
                reined in sharply about a hundred yards in front of Hettar's horse.
            </p>
            <p>"I've got to talk to Rhodar," one of the Nadraks bellowed in a shrill voice. He was a tall, emaciated man
                with a pockmarked face and a scraggly beard, but on his head he wore a crown.
            </p>
            <p>"Is this some trick?" Hettar shouted back.</p>
            <p>"Of course it is, you jackass," the scrawny man replied. "But it's not on you this time. Get me to Rhodar
                at once."
            </p>
            <p>"Keep an eye on them," Hettar told a nearby Clan-Chief, pointing at the Nadrak forces now streaming
                toward the Mallorean trenches lying in the path of the retreating army. "I'll take this maniac to see
                King Rhodar." He turned and led the group of Nadrak warnors toward the advancing infantry.
            </p>
            <p>"Rhodar!" the thin man wearing the crown shrieked as they approached the Drasnian King. "Don't you ever
                answer your mail?"
            </p>
            <p>"What are you doing, Drosta?" King Rhodar shouted back.</p>
            <p>"I'm changing sides, Rhodar," King Drosta lek Thun replied with an almost hysterical laugh. "I'm joining
                forces with you. I've been in touch with your queen for weeks. Didn't you get her messages?"
            </p>
            <p>"I thought you were playing games."</p>
            <p>"Naturally I'm playing games." The Nadrak King giggled. "I've always got something up my sleeve. Right
                now my army's opening an escape route for you. You do want to escape, don't you?"
            </p>
            <p>"Of course I do."</p>
            <p>"So do I. My troops will butcher the Malloreans in those trenches, and then we can all make a run for
                it."
            </p>
            <p>"I don't trust you, Drosta," Rhodar said bluntly.</p>
            <p>"Rhodar," Drosta said in mock chagrin, "how can you say that to an old friend?" He giggled again, his
                voice shrill and nervous.
            </p>
            <p>"I want to know why you're changing sides in the middle of a battle - particularly when your side's
                winning."
            </p>
            <p>"Rhodar, my kingdom's awash with Malloreans. If I don't help you to defeat them, 'Zakath will simply
                absorb Gar og Nadrak. It's much too long and involved to talk about now. Will you accept my aid?"
            </p>
            <p>"I'll take all the help I can get."</p>
            <p>"Good. Maybe later we can get drunk together and talk things over, but for right now, let's get out of
                here before 'Zakath hears about this and comes after me personally." The King of Gar og Nadrak laughed
                again, the same shrill, almost hysterical laugh as before. "I did it, Rhodar," he exulted. "I actually
                betrayed 'Zakath of Mallorea and got away with it."
            </p>
            <p>"You haven't gotten away with it yet, Drosta," Rhodar told him dryly.</p>
            <p>"I will if we run fast enough, Rhodar, and right now I really feel like running."</p>
            <p>'Zakath, dread Emperor of boundless Mallorea, was a man of medium height with glossy black hair and a
                pale, olive-tinged complexion. His features were regular, even handsome, but his eyes were haunted by a
                profound melancholy. He appeared to be about thirty-five years old, and he wore a plain linen robe with
                no ornament or decoration upon it to indicate his exalted rank.
            </p>
            <p>His pavilion stood in the center of the camp of the Malloreans, a vast sea of tents standing on the
                plains of Mishrak ac Thull. The earthen floor of the pavilion was covered with priceless Mallorean
                carpets, and the polished tables and chairs were inlaid with gold and with mother of pearl. Candles
                filled the pavilion with glowing light. Somewhere nearby, a small group of musicians played subdued
                melodies set in a minor key.
            </p>
            <p>The Emperor's only companion was a half grown cat, a common, mackerel-striped tabby with that gangling,
                long-legged awkwardness of the adolescent feline. While 'Zakath watched with a sort of sad-eyed
                amusement, the young cat stalked a scrap of balled-up parchment, her feet noiseless on the carpet and
                her face set in a look of intent concentration.
            </p>
            <p>As Princess Ce'Nedra and her companions were escorted into the pavilion, 'Zakath, seated on a low,
                cushioned divan, held up his hand for silence, his eyes still fixed on the cat.
            </p>
            <p>"She hunts," the Emperor murmured in a dead voice.</p>
            <p>The cat crept nearer to her intended prey, crouched and shifted her hind feet nervously, her bottom
                twitching from side to side and her tail lashing. Then she leaped at the parchment. The ball crackled as
                she pounced on it, and, startled, she jumped high into the air. She batted the ball experimentally with
                one paw; suddenly finding a new game, she bounded it across the floor with a series of soft-pawed jabs,
                scampering after it with awkward enthusiasm.
            </p>
            <p>'Zakath smiled sadly. "A young cat," he said, "with much yet to learn." He rose gracefully to his feet
                and bowed to Ce'Nedra. "Your Imperial Highness," he greeted her formally. His voice was resonant, but
                there was that peculiar deadness in it.
            </p>
            <p>"Your Imperial Majesty," Ce'Nedra replied, inclining her head in response.</p>
            <p>"Please, Goodman," 'Zakath said to Durnik, who was supporting the still-dazed Polgara, "let the lady rest
                here." He indicated the divan. "I'll send for my physicians, and they will see to her indisposition."
            </p>
            <p>"Your Majesty is too kind." Ce'Nedra mouthed the ritual phrase, but her eyes were searching 'Zakath's
                face for some hint of his real intentions. "One is surprised to meet such courtesy-under the
                circumstances."
            </p>
            <p>He smiled again, rather whimsically. "And, of course, all Malloreans are supposed to be raving fanatics
                -
            </p>
            <p>like Murgos. Courtesy is out of character, right?"</p>
            <p>"We have very little information about Mallorea and its people," the princess responded. "I was not
                certain what to expect."
            </p>
            <p>"That's surprising," the Emperor observed. "I have a great deal of information about your father and your
                Alorn friends."
            </p>
            <p>"Your Majesty has the aid of Grolims in gathering intelligence," Ce'Nedra said, "while we must rely on
                ordinary men."
            </p>
            <p>"The Grolims are overrated, Princess. Their first loyalty is to Torak; their second to their own
                hierarchy.
            </p>
            <p>They tell me only what they want to tell me - although periodically I manage to have a bit of additional
                information extracted from one of them. It helps to keep the rest of them honest."
            </p>
            <p>An attendant entered the pavilion, fell to his knees, and pressed his face to the carpet.</p>
            <p>"Yes?" 'Zakath inquired.</p>
            <p>"Your Imperial Majesty asked that the King of Thulldom be brought here," the attendant replied.</p>
            <p>"Ah, yes. I'd nearly forgotten. Please excuse me for a moment, Princess Ce'Nedra - a small matter
                requiring my attention. Please, you and your friends make yourselves comfortable." He looked critically
                at Ce'Nedra's armor. "After we've dined, I'll have the women of my household see to more suitable
                clothing for you and for Lady Polgara. Does the child require anything?" He looked curiously at Errand,
                who was intently watching the cat.
            </p>
            <p>"He'll be all right, your Majesty," Ce'Nedra replied. Her mind was working very rapidly. This urbane,
                polished gentleman might be easier to deal with than she had anticipated.
            </p>
            <p>"Bring in the King of the Thulls," 'Zakath ordered, his hand wearily shading his eyes.</p>
            <p>"At once, your Imperial Majesty," the attendant said, scrambling to his feet and backing out of the
                pavilion, bent in a deep bow.
            </p>
            <p>Gethell, the King of Mishrak ac Thull, was a thick-bodied man with lank, mud-colored hair. His face was a
                pasty white as he was led in, and he was trembling violently. "Y-Your Imperial Majesty," he stammered in
                a croaking voice.
            </p>
            <p>"You forgot to bow, Gethell," 'Zakath reminded him gently. One of the Mallorean guards doubled his fist
                and drove it into Gethell's stomach. The Thull monarch doubled over.
            </p>
            <p>"Much better," 'Zakath said approvingly. "I've asked you here in regard to some distressing news I
                received from the battlefield, Gethell. My commanders report that your troops did not behave well during
                the engagement at Thull Mardu. I am no soldier, but it seems to me that your men might have stood at
                least one

            </p>
            <p>charge by the Mimbrate knights before they ran away. I'm informed however, that they did not. Have you
                any explanation for that?"
            </p>
            <p>Gethell began to babble incoherently.</p>
            <p>"I thought not," 'Zakath told him. "It's been my experience that the failure of people to do what's
                expected of them is the result of poor leadership. It appears that you've not taken the trouble to
                encourage your men to be brave. That was a serious oversight on your part, Gethell."
            </p>
            <p>"Forgive me, dread 'Zakath," the King of the Thulls wailed, falling to his knees in terror.</p>
            <p>"But of course I forgive you, my dear fellow," 'Zakath told him. "How absurd of you to think that I
                wouldn't. A reprimand of some sort is in order, though, don't you think?"
            </p>
            <p>"I freely accept full responsibility," Gethell declared, still on his knees.</p>
            <p>"Splendid, Gethell. Absolutely splendid. I'm so glad that this interview is going so well. We've managed
                to avoid all kinds of unpleasantness." He turned to the attendant. "Would you be so good as to take King
                Gethell out and have him flogged?" he asked.
            </p>
            <p>"At once, your Imperial Majesty."</p>
            <p>Gethell's eyes started from his head as the two soldiers dragged him to his feet.</p>
            <p>"Now," 'Zakath mused. "What do we do with him after we've flogged him?" He thought a moment. "Ah, I know.
                Is there any stout timber in the vicinity?"
            </p>
            <p>"It's all open grassland, your Imperial Majesty."</p>
            <p>"What a pity." 'Zakath sighed. "I was going to have you crucified, Gethell, but I suppose I'll have to
                forgo that. Perhaps an extra fifty lashes will serve as well."
            </p>
            <p>Gethell began to blubber.</p>
            <p>"Oh, come now, my dear fellow, that just won't do. You are a king, after all, and you absolutely must
                provide a good example for your men. Run along now. I have guests. One hopes that the sight of your
                public flogging will give your troops greater incentive to do better. They'll reason that if I'd do that
                to you, then what I'll do to them will be infinitely worse. When you recover, encourage them in that
                belief, because the next time this happens, I'll have made arrangements to have the necessary timber on
                hand. Take him away," he said to his men without so much as a glance over his shoulder.
            </p>
            <p>"Forgive me for the interruption, your Highness," he apologized. "These little administrative details
                consume so much of one's time." The King of the Thulls was dragged sobbing from the pavilion. "I've
                ordered a small supper for you and your friends, Princess Ce'Nedra," 'Zakath continued. "All the finest
                delicacies. Then I'll make arrangements for the absolute comfort of you and your companions."
            </p>
            <p>"I hope that this won't offend your Imperial Majesty," Ce'Nedra began bravely, "but one is curious about
                your plans in regard to our future."
            </p>
            <p>"Please set your mind at rest, your Highness," 'Zakath replied in his dead-sounding voice. "Word has
                reached me that the madman, Taur Urgas, is dead. I will never be able to repay you for that service, and
                I bear you absolutely no ill will whatsoever." He glanced toward one corner of his tent where his cat,
                purring

            </p>
            <p>ecstatically, was lying on her back in Errand's lap with all four paws in the air. The smiling child was
                gently stroking her furry belly. "How charming," 'Zakath murmured in an oddly melancholy voice.
            </p>
            <p>Then the Emperor of boundless Mallorea rose and approached the divan where Durnik supported Lady Polgara.
                "My Queen," he said, bowing to her with profound respect. "Your beauty quite transcends all reports."
            </p>
            <p>Polgara opened her eyes and gave him a level gaze. A wild hope leaped in Ce'Nedra's heart. Polgara was
                conscious.
            </p>
            <p>"You are courteous, my Lord," Polgara told him in a weak voice.</p>
            <p>"You are my queen, Polgara," 'Zakath told her, "and I can now understand my God's ages-old longing for
                you." He sighed then as his apparently habitual melancholy descended upon him once again.
            </p>
            <p>"What are you going to do with us?" Durnik asked, his arms still holding Polgara protectively.</p>
            <p>'Zakath sighed again. "The God of my people is not a good or kindly God," he told the smith. "If the
                arranging of things had been left to me, all might have been different. I was not consulted, however. I
                am Angarak, and I must bow to the will of Torak. The sleep of the Dragon God grows fitful, and I must
                obey his commands. Though it wounds me deeply, I must turn you and your companions over to the Grolims.
            </p>
            <p>They will deliver you up to Zedar, disciple of Torak in Cthol Mishrak, City of Night, where he will
                decide your fate."

        <chapter number="19">
            <p>THEY REMAINED FOR nearly a week in the Imperial compound as the personal guests of the Emperor</p>
            <p>'Zakath, who for some strange reason seemed to take a melancholy pleasure in their company. Quarters were
                provided for them within the labyrinth of silken tents and pavilions that sheltered 'Zakath's household
                staff, and their every comfort received the personal attention of the Emperor himself.
            </p>
            <p>The strange, sad-eyed man puzzled Princess Ce'Nedra. Although he was the absolute soul of courtesy, the
                memory of his interview with King Gethell frightened her. His ruthlessness was all the more chilling
                because he never lost his temper. He never seemed to sleep either, and when, often in the middle of the
                night, he felt some obscure need for conversation, he would send for Ce'Nedra. He never apologized for
                having interrupted her rest. It apparently did not even occur to him that his summons might in some way
                inconvenience her.
            </p>
            <p>"Where did King Rhodar receive his military training?" 'Zakath asked her during one of these midnight
                interviews. "None of my information about him even hints about any such talent." The Emperor was seated
                deep in the purple cushions of a soft chair with golden candlelight playing over his face and his cat
                dozing in his lap.
            </p>
            <p>"I really couldn't say, your Majesty," Ce'Nedra replied, toying absently with the sleeve of the pale silk
                gown that had been provided for her soon after her arrival. "I only met Rhodar last winter."
            </p>
            <p>"Very peculiar," 'Zakath mused. "We had always assumed that he was just a foolish old man doting on his
                young wife. We had never even considered him a possible threat. We concentrated our attentions on Brand
                and Anheg. Brand is too self effacing to be a good leader, and Anheg seemed too erratic to give us much
                concern. Then Rhodar appeared out of nowhere to take charge of things. The Alorns are an enigma, aren't
                they? How can a sensible Tolnedran girl stand them?"
            </p>
            <p>She smiled briefly. "They have a certain charm, your Majesty," she told him rather pertly.</p>
            <p>"Where is Belgarion?" The question came without any warning. ''</p>
            <p>"We don't know, your Majesty," Ce'Nedra answered evasively. "Lady Polgara was furious when he slipped
                away."
            </p>
            <p>"In the company of Belgarath and Kheldar," the Emperor added."We heard of the search for them. Tell me,
                Princess, does he by any chance have Cthrag Yaska with him?"
            </p>
            <p>"Cthrag Yaska?"</p>
            <p>"The burning stone - what you in the west call the Orb of Aldur "</p>
            <p>"I'm not at liberty to discuss that, your Majesty," she told him rather primly, "and I'm sure you're too
                courteous to try to wring the information out of me."
            </p>
            <p>"Princess," he said reprovingly.</p>
            <p>"I'm sorry, your Majesty," she apologized and gave him that quick, little girl smile that was always her
                weapon of last resort.
            </p>
            <p>'Zakath smiled gently. "You're a devious young woman, Ce'Nedra," he said.</p>
            <p>"Yes, your Majesty," she acknowledged. "What prompted you and Taur Urgas to bury your enmity and unite
                against us?" Ce'Nedra wanted to demonstrate that she too could ask surprise questions.
            </p>
            <p>"There was no unity in our attack, Princess," he replied. "I was merely responding to Taur Urgas."</p>
            <p>"I don't understand."</p>
            <p>"So long as he remained at Rak Goska, I was perfectly content to stay at Thull Zelik; but as soon as he
                began to march north, I had to respond. The land of the Thulls is of too much strategic importance to
                allow it to be occupied by a hostile force."
            </p>
            <p>"And what now, 'Zakath?" Ce'Nedra asked him impudently. "Taur Urgas is dead. Where will you turn now in
                search of an enemy?"
            </p>
            <p>He smiled a wintry smile. "How little you understand us, Ce'Nedra. Taur Urgas was only the symbol of
                Murgo fanaticism. Ctuchik is dead, and Taur Urgas is dead, but Murgodom lives on - even as Mallorea will
                live on when I am gone. Our enmity goes back for eons. At last, however, a Mallorean Emperor is in a
                position to crush Cthol Murgos once and for all and make himself undisputed overking of Angarak."
            </p>
            <p>"It's all for power, then?"</p>
            <p>"What else is there?" he asked sadly. "When I was very young, I thought that there might be something
                else-but events proved that I was wrong." A brief look of pain crossed his face, and he sighed. "In time
                you will discover that same truth. Your Belgarion will grow colder as the years pass and the chill
                satisfaction of power comes more and more to possess him. When it is complete, and only his love of
                power remains, then he and I will move against each other as inevitably as two great tides. I will not
                attack him until his education is complete. There is no satisfaction in destroying a man who does not
                fully comprehend reality.
            </p>
            <p>When all of his illusions are gone and only his love of power remains, then he will be a fit opponent."
                His face had grown bleak. He looked at her, his eyes as dead and cold as ice. "I think I've kept you
                from your
            </p>
            <p>rest too long, Princess," he said. "Go to bed and dream of love and other absurdities. The dreams will
                die all too soon, so enjoy them while you can."
            </p>
            <p>Early the next morning, Ce'Nedra entered the pavilion where Polgara rested, recuperating from the
                struggle with the Grolims at Thull Mardu. She was alert, but still dreadfully weak.
            </p>
            <p>"He's every bit as insane as Taur Urgas was," Ce'Nedra reported. "He's so obsessed with the idea of
                becoming overking of Angarak that he isn't even paying any attention to what we've been doing."
            </p>
            <p>"That may change once Anheg starts sinking his troop ships," Polgara replied. "There's nothing we can do
                at the moment, so just keep listening to him and be polite."
            </p>
            <p>"Do you think we should try to escape?"</p>
            <p>"No."</p>
            <p>Ce'Nedra looked at her, a bit startled.</p>
            <p>"What's happening is supposed to happen. There's some reason that the four of us - you, Durnik, Errand,
                and I - are supposed to go to Mallorea. Let's not tamper with it."
            </p>
            <p>"You knew this was going to happen?"</p>
            <p>Polgara gave her a weary smile. "I knew that's where we were going. I didn't know how, exactly. 'Zakath
                isn't interfering in any way, so don't aggravate him."
            </p>
            <p>Ce'Nedra sighed in resignation. "Whatever you say, Lady Polgara," she said.</p>
            <p>It was early afternoon of that same day when the first reports of King Anheg's activities in the Sea of
                the East reached the Emperor 'Zakath. Ce'Nedra, who was present when the dispatches were delivered, felt
                a secret sense of satisfaction as the icy man showed the first hint of irritation she had seen in him.
            </p>
            <p>"Are you certain of this?" he demanded of the trembling messenger, holding up the parchment.</p>
            <p>"I only carried the dispatch, dread Lord." The messenger quailed, cringing back from his Emperor's
                anger.
            </p>
            <p>"Were you at Thull Zelik when the ships arnved?"</p>
            <p>"There was only one ship, dread Lord."</p>
            <p>"One ship out of fifty?" 'Zakath's tone was incredulous. "Weren't there others - perhaps coming along the
                coast?"
            </p>
            <p>"The sailors said there weren't, your Imperial Majesty."</p>
            <p>"What kind of barbarian is this Anheg of Cherek?" 'Zakath exclaimed to Ce'Nedra. "Each of those ships
                carried two hundred men."
            </p>
            <p>"King Anheg is an Alorn, your Majesty," Ce'Nedra replied coolly. "They're an unpredictable people."</p>
            <p>With a great deal of effort, 'Zakath regained his composure. "I see," he said after a moment's
                reflection.
            </p>
            <p>"This was your plan from the beginning, wasn't it, Princess? The entire attack on Thull Mardu was a
                subterfuge."
            </p>
            <p>"Not entirely, your Majesty. I was assured that the city had to be neutralized to permit the passage of
                the fleet."
            </p>
            <p>"But why is he drowning my soldiers? I bear the Alorns no malice."</p>
            <p>"Torak does - or so I'm told - and it is Torak who will command the combined armies of Angarak. We cannot
                allow your forces to land on this continent, your Majesty. We cannot give Torak that advantage."
            </p>
            <p>"Torak is asleep - and he's likely to remain so for a number of years yet."</p>
            <p>"Our information indicates that it will not be nearly so long. Belgarath himself is convinced that the
                time is near at hand."
            </p>
            <p>His eyes narrowed slightly. "I must hand you all over to the Grolims, then," he said. "I'd hoped to wait
                until Polgara had regained her strength before subjecting her to the journey; but if what you say is
                true, there is little time to waste. Advise your friends to make their preparations, Princess. You will
                depart for Thull Zelik tomorrow morning."
            </p>
            <p>"As your Majesty wishes," Ce'Nedra replied, a chill going down her spine as she bowed her head in
                acquiescence.
            </p>
            <p>"I am a secular man, Princess," he said by way of explanation. "I bow to the altar of Torak when the
                occasion demands it, but I make no pretence at excessive piety. I will not involve myself in a religious
                dispute between Belgarath and Zedar, and I most certainly will not stand between Torak and Aldur when
                they confront each other. I would strongly advise you to follow the same course."
            </p>
            <p>"That decision is not mine to make, your Majesty. My part in this was decided for me long before I was
                born."
            </p>
            <p>He looked amused. "The Prophecy, you mean? We Angaraks have one also, Princess, and I don't imagine yours
                is any more reliable than ours. Prophecy is no more than a trick of the priesthood to maintain its grip
                on the gullible."
            </p>
            <p>"Then you believe in nothing, my Lord?"</p>
            <p>"I believe in my own power. Nothing else makes any sense."</p>
            <p>The Grolims who escorted them in easy stages northward across the summer-browned plains of Mishrak ac
                Thull toward Thull Zelik were coldly proper. Ce'Nedra could not be sure if their behavior was the result
                of warnings from the Emperor of Mallorea or their fear of Polgara. The stifling heat was past now, and
                the air smelled faintly of the dusty end of summer. The Thullish plain was dotted with villages, random
                collections of thatch-roofed cottages and dirt streets. The villagers watched, sullen and afraid, as the
                priests of Torak rode through the little towns, their faces cold and aloof.
            </p>
            <p>The plain to the west of Thull Zelik was covered with the red tents of the vast staging area that had
                been erected for the Mallorean army. With the exception of caretaker detachments, however, the huge camp
                was empty. The troops already in Mishrak ac Thull were with 'Zakath near Thull Mardu, and the steady
                stream of new arrivals had been quite suddenly cut off.
            </p>
            <p>Thull Zelik itself was like any port town in the world, smelling of salt water, fish, tar, and rotting
                seaweed.
            </p>
            <p>The gray stone buildings were low and squat, almost like the Thulls themselves, and the cobblestoned
                streets all sloped down to the harbor, which lay in the curve of a broad estuary and faced a somewhat
                similar harbor on the other side.
            </p>
            <p>"What city is that?" Ce'Nedra curiously asked one of the Grolims as she looked across the dirty water
                toward the far shore.
            </p>
            <p>"Yar Marak," the black-robed priest answered curtly.</p>
            <p>"Ah," she said, remembering now her tedious geography lessons. The two cities, one Thullish, the other
                Nadrak, faced each other across the estuary at the mouth of the River Cordu, and the boundary between
                Mishrak ac Thull and Gar og Nadrak ran down the precise center of the river.
            </p>
            <p>"When the Emperor returns from Thull Mardu, I imagine he'll take steps to eradicate that place over
                there,"
            </p>
            <p>one of the other Grolims added. "He was not pleased with the behavior of King Drosta on the battlefield,
                and some chastisement seems in order."
            </p>
            <p>They proceeded directly down a cobbled avenue to the harbor, where but a few ships were moored to the
                wharves.
            </p>
            <p>"My crew absolutely refuses to put to sea," the Mallorean captain of the ship upon which they were to
                embark reported to the Grolims. "The Chereks out there are like a pack of wolves, burning and sinking
                everything afloat."
            </p>
            <p>"The Cherek fleet is farther south," the priest in charge of the detachment of Grolims declared.</p>
            <p>"The Cherek fleet is everywhere, revered priest," the captain disagreed. "Two days ago they burned four
                coastal towns two hundred leagues to the south of here, and yesterday they sank a dozen ships a hundred
                leagues to the north. You wouldn't believe how fast they can move. They don't even take the time to loot
                the towns they burn." He shuddered. "They're not men! They're a natural disaster."
            </p>
            <p>"We will set sail within the hour," the Grolim insisted.</p>
            <p>"Not unless your priests know how to man oars and handle the rigging," the captain told him. "My men are
                terrified. They won't sail."
            </p>
            <p>"We'll convince them," the Grolim said darkly. He gave a few orders to his underpriests. An altar was
                quickly erected on the high stern deck, and a brazier filled with glowing coals was placed to one side
                of it.
            </p>
            <p>The leader of the Grolims took his place at the altar and began chanting in a deep, hollow voice, his
                arms raised to the sky. In his right hand he held a gleaming knife. At random, his cohorts selected a
                sailor and dragged him, screaming and struggling, to the stern deck. As Ce'Nedra watched with horror, he
                was bent backward across the altar and butchered with an almost casual efficiency. The Grolim who had
                wielded the knife lifted the dead man's dripping heart.
            </p>
            <p>"Behold our offering, Dragon-God of Angarak!" he cried in a great voice, then turned and deposited the
                heart in the smoking brazier. The heart steamed and sizzled horribly for a moment, then began to blacken
                and shrivel as the fire consumed it. From the bow of the ship a gong clanged in iron celebration of the
                sacrifice.
            </p>
            <p>The Grolim at the altar, his bloody hands dripping, turned to confront the ashen-faced sailors crowded
                amidships.
            </p>
            <p>"Our ceremonies will continue until the ship sails," he told them. "Who will be the next to give his
                heart to our beloved God?"
            </p>
            <p>The ship set sail immediately.</p>
            <p>Ce'Nedra, sick with revulsion, turned her face away. She looked at Polgara, whose eyes burned with hatred
                and who seemed in the grip of an overpowering interior struggle. Ce'Nedra knew her, and she knew that it
                was only by a tremendous effort of her will that Polgara was able to keep herself from unleashing a
                terrible retribution on the bloodstained Grolim at the altar. Beside her, protected in the clasp of one
                of her arms, stood Errand. On the child's face was an expression Ce'Nedra had never seen there before.
                His look was sad, compassionate, and at the same time filled with a kind of iron-hard resolution, as if,
                had he but the power, he would destroy every altar to Torak in all the world.
            </p>
            <p>"You will go below decks now," one of their Grolim captors told them. "It will be a matter of some days
                before we reach the shores of boundless Mallorea."
            </p>
            <p>They sailed north, hugging the Nadrak coastline, fearfully ready to run for any beach that offered
                itself, should Cherek ships appear on the horizon. At a certain point, the Mallorean captain peered
                about at the empty sea, swallowed hard, and swung his tiller over for the quick, terrified dash across
                open water to the east.
            </p>
            <p>Once, a day or more out from the Nadrak coast, they saw a dreadful column of thick black smoke rising far
                to the south, and a day or so farther on they sailed through a sea littered with charred debris where
                bodies, pale and bloated, bobbed in the dark waves of the eastern sea. The frightened sailors pulled
                their oars with all their strength, not even needing the encouragement of whips to row faster.
            </p>
            <p>Then, one murky morning when the sky behind them threatened rain squalls and the air was oppressively
                heavy with the advancing storm, a low, dark smudge appeared on the horizon ahead of them, and the
                sailors doubled their efforts, rushing desperately toward the safety of the Mallorean coast ahead.
            </p>
            <p>The beach upon which the small boats from their ship landed them was a sloping shingle of dark,
                salt-crusted gravel where the waves made a strange, mournful sighing as they receded. Awaiting them some
                distance up from the water's edge sat a mounted party of Grolims, their black robes belted at the waist
                with crimson sashes.
            </p>
            <p>"Archpriests," Polgara noted coldly. "We're to be escorted with some ceremony, I take it."</p>
            <p>The Grolim who had commanded their escort went quickly up the gravel stand toward the waiting group and
                prostrated himself before them, speaking with a hushed reverence. One of the Archpriests, an aged man
                with a deeply lined face and sunken eyes, dismounted rather stiffly and came down to where Ce'Nedra and
                her friends had just stepped from the small boat.
            </p>
            <p>"My Queen," he said to Polgara, bowing respectfully. "I am Urtag, Archpriest of the district of Camat. I
                am here with my brethren to escort you to the City of Night."
            </p>
            <p>"I'm disappointed not to find Zedar waiting," the sorceress replied coldly. "I trust he's not
                indisposed."
            </p>
            <p>Urtag gave her a quick look of irritation. "Do not rail against your foreordained fate, Queen of
                Angarak,"
            </p>
            <p>he advised her.</p>
            <p>"I have two fates awaiting me, Urtag," she said. "Which one I will follow has not yet been decided."</p>
            <p>"I do not have any doubts about the matter," he declared.</p>
            <p>"That's probably because you've never dared to look at the alternatives," she replied. "Shall we go,
                Urtag?
            </p>
            <p>A windy beach is hardly the place for philosophical discussion."</p>
            <p>The Grolim Archpriests had brought horses with them, and the party was soon mounted and riding away from
                the sea across a line of low, wooded hills in a generally northeasterly direction. The trees bordering
                the upper edge of the gravel beach had been dark-boughed spruces, but once they topped the first rise
                they entered a vast forest of white-barked aspens. To Ce'Nedra's eyes, the stark, white trunks looked
                almost corpselike, and the entire forest had a gloomy, unhealthy quality about it.
            </p>
            <p>"Mistress Pol," Durnik said in a voice that was scarcely more than a whisper, "shouldn't we be working on
                some kind of plan?"
            </p>
            <p>"For what, Durnik?" she asked him.</p>
            <p>"For our escape, of course."</p>
            <p>"But we don't want to escape, Durnik."</p>
            <p>"We don't?"</p>
            <p>"The Grolims are taking us to the place we want to go."</p>
            <p>"Why do we want to go to this Cthol Mishrak of theirs?"</p>
            <p>"We have something to do there."</p>
            <p>"From everything I've heard it's a bad sort of place," he told her. "Are you sure you haven't made some
                mistake?"
            </p>
            <p>She reached out and laid her hand on his arm. "Dear Durnik," she said, "you'll just have to trust me."
            </p>
            <p>"Of course, Mistress Pol," he replied immediately. "But shouldn't I know what to expect? If I should have
                to take steps to protect you, I ought to be prepared."
            </p>
            <p>"I'd tell you if I knew, Durnik," she said, "but I don't know what we should expect. All I know is that
                the four of us are supposed to go to Cthol Mishrak. What's going to happen there needs us in order for
                it to be complete. Each of us has something to do there."
            </p>
            <p>"Even me?"</p>
            <p>"Especially you, Durnik. At first I didn't understand who you really are. That's why I tried to keep you
                from coming along. But now I do understand. You have to be there because you're going to do the one
                thing that's going to turn the entire outcome one way or the other."
            </p>
            <p>"What is it?"</p>
            <p>"We don't know."</p>
            <p>His eyes grew wide. "What if I do it wrong?" he asked in a worried voice.</p>
            <p>"I don't think you can," she reassured him. "From everything I understand, what you're going to do will
                flow very naturally out of who and what you are." She gave him a brief, wry little smile. "You won't be
            </p>
            <p>able to do it wrong, Durnik - any more than you'd be able to lie or cheat or steal. It's built into you
                to do it right, so don't worry about it."
            </p>
            <p>"That's all very well for you to say, Mistress Pol," he replied, "but if you don't mind, I will worry
                about it just a bit - privately, of course."
            </p>
            <p>She laughed then, a light, fond little laugh. "You dear, dear man," she said impulsively taking his
                hand.
            </p>
            <p>"Whatever would we do without you?"</p>
            <p>Durnik blushed and tried to look away, but her glorious eyes held his, and he blushed even more.</p>
            <p>After they had passed through the forest of aspen, they entered a strangely desolate landscape. White
                boulders stuck up out of tangled weeds like tombstones in a long-abandoned graveyard, and dead trees
                thrust their crooked limbs at the overcast sky like pleading fingers. The horizon ahead was covered with
                a bank of darker cloud, a cloud so intensely black that it seemed almost purple. Oddly, Ce'Nedra noted,
                the cloudbank did not seem to be moving at all. There was no sign anywhere of any human habitation, and
                the route they followed was not even marked by a trail.
            </p>
            <p>"Does no one live there?" the princess asked Polgara.</p>
            <p>"Cthol Mishrak is deserted except for a few Grolims," the sorceress replied. "Torak smashed the city and
                drove its people out the day my father and King Cherek and his sons stole the Orb back from the iron
                tower."
            </p>
            <p>"When was that?"</p>
            <p>"A very long time ago, Ce'Nedra. As nearly as we've been able to determine, it was precisely on the same
                day that Beldaran and I were born - and the day our mother died. It's a bit hard to say for sure. We
                were a bit casual about keeping track of time in those days."
            </p>
            <p>"If your mother had died and Belgarath was here, who took care of you?"</p>
            <p>"Beldin, of course." Polgara smiled. "He wasn't a very good mother, but he did the best he could until
                father returned."
            </p>
            <p>"Is that why you're so fond of him?"</p>
            <p>"One of the reasons, yes."</p>
            <p>The ominous cloudbank still did not move. It stretched across the sky as stationary as a range of
                mountains; as they rode toward it, it loomed higher and higher.
            </p>
            <p>"That's a very strange cloud," Durnik noted, looking speculatively at the thick curtain of purple ahead.
                "The storm is coming in behind us, but that cloud doesn't seem to be moving at all."
            </p>
            <p>"It doesn't move, Durnik," Polgara told him. "It never has moved. When the Angaraks built Cthol Mishrak,
                Torak put that cloud there to hide the city. It's been there ever since."
            </p>
            <p>"How long is that?"</p>
            <p>"About five thousand years."</p>
            <p>"The sun never shines there?"</p>
            <p>"Never."</p>
            <p>The Grolim Archpriests had begun to look about with a certain apprehension, and finally Urtag called a
                halt. "We must make ourselves known," he declared. "We don't want the watchers to mistake us for
                intruders."
            </p>
            <p>The other Archpriests nodded nervously, and then all removed polished steel masks from beneath their
                robes and carefully covered their faces with them. Then each of them untied a thick torch from his
                saddle and ignited it with a brief, mumbled incantation. The torches burned with a peculiarly
                green-tinged flame and gave off a reeking, sulfurous smoke.
            </p>
            <p>"I wonder what would happen if I were to blow out your torches," Polgara suggested with a hint of a
                mischievous smile. "I could, you know."
            </p>
            <p>Urtag gave her a worried look. "This is no time for foolishness, my Lady," he warned her. "The watchers
                are very savage with intruders. Our lives depend on those torches. Please don't do anything to bring
                down a disaster on us all."
            </p>
            <p>She laughed lightly and let it go at that.</p>
            <p>As they rode in beneath the cloud, it grew steadily darker. It was not precisely the clean darkness of
                night, but was rather a kind of dirty murkiness, a deep shade hovering in the air. They crested a rise
                and saw before them a cloud-enshrouded basin, and in its center, half obscured by the pervasive gloom,
                stood the ravaged City of Night. The vegetation around them had shrunk to a few sparse weeds and an
                unhealthy looking, stunted grass, pale and sick for want of sun. The boulders thrusting up out of the
                earth were splotched with a sort of leprous lichen that ate into the rock itself, and nodules of a white
                fungus lumped in grotesque profusion, spreading out across the dank soil as if the ground itself were
                diseased.
            </p>
            <p>With a slow, careful pace, their sputtering torches held above their heads, the Grolim Archpriests led
                the way down into the gloomy basin and across the unwholesome plain toward the shattered walls of Cthol
                Mishrak.
            </p>
            <p>As they entered the city, the princess saw furtive hints of movement among the tumbled stones. Shadowy
                forms scurried from place to place among the ruins, and the sound of their movements was the clicking
                scrape made by creatures whose feet were clawed. Some of the shapes were upright, others were not.
            </p>
            <p>Ce'Nedra grew cold and afraid. The watchers of Cthol Mishrak were neither beast nor human, and they
                seemed to exude a kind of indiscriminate malice toward all other living things. More than anything, she
                was afraid that one of them might suddenly turn and confront her with a face that might rip away her
                sanity by its hideousness.
            </p>
            <p>As they passed down a broken street, Urtag began to intone an ancient prayer to Torak, his voice hollow
                and shaking. The dank air grew colder, and the diseaselike lichen ate at the tumbled stones of the
                ruined houses. Mold seemed to cling to everything, and the pale fungus grew in grotesque lumps in
                corners and crannies. The smell of decay was everywhere, a damp, rotten stench, and slimy pools of
                stagnant water lay among the ruins.
            </p>
            <p>In the center of the city stood the rusted stump of a vast iron tower, the broken-off girders which had
                supported it thicker than a man's waist. Just to the south of the stump lay a broad, rusted trail of
                total destruction where the tower had fallen, crushing everything beneath it. Over the eons, the iron
                had rusted down into a sort of damp red mud that outlined the enormous dimensions of the fallen
                structure.
            </p>
            <p>The stump had eroded down, the years rounding off the broken edges. The rust mingled in places with a
                kind of thick black ooze that ran down the faces of the iron plates like gobbets of clotted blood.
            </p>
            <p>Urtag, trembling visibly now, dismounted before a vast, arched portal and led them through a half open
                iron door. The echoing chamber they entered was as large as the Imperial throne room in Tol Honeth.
            </p>
            <p>Wordlessly, his torch held high over his head, Urtag led them across the pitted floor to another
                iron-arched doorway and then down a flight of clanging iron steps that reached into the darkness
                beneath. At the bottom of the stairs, perhaps fifty feet below the wreckage above, stood another door of
                black iron, studded with great, round rivetheads. Hesitantly, Urtag rapped his knuckles on the door, and
                the sound of his rapping echoed hollowly in the chamber beyond.
            </p>
            <p>"Who comes to disturb the slumber of the Dragon-God of Angarak?" a muffled voice demanded from behind the
                door.
            </p>
            <p>"I am Urtag, the Archpriest of Camat." The Grolim's voice was friughtened. "As commanded, I bring the
                prisoners to the Disciple of Torak."
            </p>
            <p>There was a moment of silence, and then the rattling sound of an immense chain, followed by the grating
                of an enormous bolt. Then slowly, creakingly, the door opened.
            </p>
            <p>Ce'Nedra gasped. Standing in the doorway was Belgarath! It was a moment before her startled eyes began to
                sort out the subtle differences that informed her that the white-haired man before her was not indeed
                the old sorcerer, but rather someone who looked so much like him that they could easily pass for
                brothers.
            </p>
            <p>Subtle though the differences were, they were nonetheless profound. In the eyes of the man in the doorway
                there was a haunted look - a look compounded of grief and horror and a dreadful self loathing, all
                overlaid with the helpless adoration of a man who has given himself utterly to a dreadful master.
            </p>
            <p>"Welcome to the tomb of the one-eyed God, Polgara," he greeted the sorceress.</p>
            <p>"It's been a long time, Belzedar," she replied in an oddly neutral voice.</p>
            <p>"I've given up the right to that name," he told her, and his tone was faintly regretful.</p>
            <p>"It was your decision, Zedar."</p>
            <p>He shrugged. "Perhaps," he said. "Perhaps not. Maybe what I'm doing is also necessary." He pushed the
                door open wider. "Come inside, if you will. This crypt is habitable - if only barely." He looked
                directly at Urtag then. "You have performed a service, Urtag, Archpriest of Torak, and a service should
                not be unrewarded. Come." And he turned and led them back into the vaulted chamber beyond. The walls
                were of stone, massive blocks set without mortar, and bolted to the topmost tier were great iron arches
                supporting the ceiling and the immense ruin above. The great chill of masses of cold stone and iron was
                held off by large, glowing braziers set in each corner. In the center of the room stood a table and
                several chairs, and along one wall lay a cluster of loosely rolled pallets and a neat stack of gray
                woolen blankets. On the table stood a pair of large candles, their flame unwinking and steady in the
                dead air of the tomb.
            </p>
            <p>Zedar paused briefly at the table to pick up one of the candles, then led them across the flagstone floor
                to an arched alcove set in the far wall. "Your reward, Urtag," he said to the Grolim. "Come and behold
                the face of your God." He lifted the candle.
            </p>
            <p>Lying upon its back on a stone bier within the alcove lay a huge figure, robed and cowled in black. The
                face was concealed by a polished steel mask. The eyes of the mask were closed.
            </p>
            <p>Urtag took one terrified look, then prostrated himself on the floor. There was a deep, rasping sigh, and
                the recumbent figure in the alcove moved slightly. As Ce'Nedra stared in horrified fascination, the
                vast, steel-covered face turned restlessly toward them. For a moment the polished left eyelid opened.
                Behind that eyelid burned the dreadful fire of the eye that was not. The steel face moved as if it were
                flesh, twisting into an expression of contempt at the priest groveling on the flagstones, and a hollow
                murmuring came from behind the polished lips.
            </p>
            <p>Urtag started violently and raised his suddenly stricken face, listening to the hollow muttering which he
                alone in the dim crypt could hear clearly. The hollow voice continued, murmuring in Urtag's ears. The
                Archpriest's face drained as he listened, and a look of unspeakable horror slowly twisted his features.
                The hollow muttering droned on. The words were indistinct, but the inflections were not. Desperately,
                Ce'Nedra covered her ears.
            </p>
            <p>Finally Urtag screamed and scrambled to his feet. His face had gone absolutely white, and his eyes were
                starting from their sockets. Gibbering insanely, Urtag fled, and the sound of his screams echoed back
                down the iron stairway, as he ran in terror from the ruined tower.
            </p>
        </chapter>
        <chapter number="20">
            <p>THE WHISPERING HAD begun almost as soon as Belgarath, Silk, and Garion reached the coast of Mallorea. It
                was indistinct at first, little more than a sibilant breath sounding perpetually in Garion's ears, but
                in the days that followed as they moved steadily south, occasional words began to emerge. The words were
                the sort to be reckoned with home, mother, love, and death - words upon which attention immediately
                fastened.
            </p>
            <p>Unlike the land of the Morindim which they had left behind, northern - most Mallorea was a land of
                rolling hills covered with a toughstemmed, dark green grass. Occasional nameless rivers wound among
                those hills, roiling and turbulent beneath a lead gray sky. They had not seen the sun for what seemed
                weeks. A sort of dry overcast had moved in off the Sea of the East, and a stiff breeze, chill and
                smelling of the polar ice, pressed continually at their backs as they moved south.
            </p>
            <p>Belgarath now rode with extreme caution. There was no sign of that half doze that was his custom in more
                civilized parts of the world, and Garion could feel the subtle push of the old man's mind as he probed
                ahead for any hidden dangers. So delicate was the sorcerer's searching that it seemed only a slowly
                expiring breath, light, tentative, concealed artfully in the sound of the breeze passing through the
                tall grass.
            </p>
            <p>Silk also rode warily, pausing frequently to listen, and seeming on occasion to sniff at the air. Often
                he would even go so far as to dismount and put his ear to the turf, to see if he might pick up the
                muffled tread of unseen horses approaching.
            </p>
            <p>"Nervous work," the little man said as he remounted after one such pause.</p>
            <p>"Better to be a little overcautious than to blunder into something," Belgarath replied. "Did you hear
                anything?"
            </p>
            <p>"I think I heard a worm crawling around down there," Silk answered brightly. "He didn't say anything,
                though. You know how worms are."
            </p>
            <p>"Do you mind?"</p>
            <p>"You did ask, Belgarath."</p>
            <p>"Oh, shut up!"</p>
            <p>"You heard him ask, didn't you, Garion?"</p>
            <p>"That is probably the most offensive habit I've ever encountered in anyone," Belgarath told the little
                thief.
            </p>
            <p>"I know," Silk answered. "That's why I do it. Infuriating, isn't it? How far do we have to go before we
                come to woods again?"
            </p>
            <p>"Several more days. We're still a goodly distance north of the tree line. Winter's too long and summer
                too short for trees to grow up here."
            </p>
            <p>"Boring sort of place, isn't it?" Silk observed, looking around at the endless grass and the rounded
                hills that all looked the same.
            </p>
            <p>"Under the circumstances, I can stand a little boredom. The alternatives aren't all that pleasant."</p>
            <p>"I can accept that."</p>
            <p>They rode on, their horses wading through the knee-high, gray-green grass.</p>
            <p>The whispering inside Garion's head began again.</p>
            <p>"Hear me, Child of Light."</p>
            <p>That sentence emerged quite clearly from the rest of the unintelligible sibilance. There was a dreadfully
                compelling quality in that single statement. Garion concentrated, trying to hear more.
            </p>
            <p>"I wouldn't do that, " the familiar dry voice told him.</p>
            <p>"What?"</p>
            <p>"Don't do what he tells you to do. "</p>
            <p>"Who is it?"</p>
            <p>"Torak, of course. Who did you think it was?"</p>
            <p>"He's awake?"</p>
            <p>"Not yet. Not fully at any rate - but then he's never been entirely asleep either."</p>
            <p>"What's he trying to do?"</p>
            <p>"He's trying to talk you out of killing him."</p>
            <p>"He's not afraid of me, is he?"</p>
            <p>"Of course he's afraid. He doesn't know what's going to happen any more than you do, and he's just as
                frightened of you as you are of him."
            </p>
            <p>That immediately made Garion feel better. "What should I do about the way he keeps whispering to me?"</p>
            <p>"There's not much you can do. Just don't get into the habit of obeying his orders, that's all. "</p>
            <p>They camped that evening as they usually did in a well-sheltered hollow between two hills and, as usual,
                they built no fire to give away their location.
            </p>
            <p>"I'm getting a bit tired of cold suppers," Silk complained, biting down hard on a piece of dried meat.
                "This beef's like a strip of old leather."
            </p>
            <p>"The exercise is good for your jaws," Belgarath told him.</p>
            <p>"You can be a very unpleasant old man when you set your mind to it, do you know that?"</p>
            <p>"The nights are getting longer, aren't they?" Garion said to head off any further wrangling.</p>
            <p>"The summer's winding down," Belgarath told him. "It will be autumn up here in another few weeks, and
                winter will be right on its heels."
            </p>
            <p>"I wonder where we'll be when winter comes," Garion said rather plaintively.</p>
            <p>"I wouldn't do that," Silk advised. "Thinking about it isn't going to help, and it's only going to make
                you nervous."
            </p>
            <p>"Nervouser," Garion corrected. "I'm already nervous."</p>
            <p>"Is there such a word as 'nervouser?' " Silk asked Belgarath curiously.</p>
            <p>"There is now," Belgarath replied. "Garion just invented it."</p>
            <p>"I wish I could invent a word," Silk said admiringly to Garion, his ferretlike little eyes gleaming
                mischievously.
            </p>
            <p>"Please don't poke fun at me, Silk. I'm having enough trouble as it is."</p>
            <p>"Let's get some sleep," Belgarath suggested. "This conversation isn't going anywhere, and we've got a
                long way to ride tomorrow."
            </p>
            <p>That night the whispering invaded Garion's sleep, and it seemed to convey its meaning in images rather
                than words. There was an offer of friendship - of a hand outstretched in love. The loneliness that had
                haunted his boyhood from the moment he had discovered that he was an orphan seemed to fade, to pass
                somehow behind him with that offer, and he found himself rather desperately wanting to run toward that
                hand reaching toward him.
            </p>
            <p>Then, very clearly, he saw two figures standing side by side. The figure of the man was very tall and
                very powerful, and the figure of the woman was so familiar that the very sight of her caught at Garion's
                heart.
            </p>
            <p>The tall, powerful man seemed to be a stranger, and yet was not. His face went far beyond mere human
                handsomeness. It was quite the most beautiful face Garion had ever seen. The woman, of course, was not a
            </p>
            <p>stranger. The white lock at the brow and the glorious eyes were the most familiar things in Garion's
                life.
            </p>
            <p>Side by side, the beautiful stranger and Aunt Pol reached out their arms to him.</p>
            <p>"You will be our son," the whispering voice told him. "Our beloved son. I will be your father, and
                Polgara your mother. This will be no imaginary thing, Child of Light, for I can make all things happen.
                Polgara will really be your mother, and all of her love will be yours alone; and I, your father, will
                love and cherish you both. Will you turn away from us and face again the bitter loneliness of the orphan
                child? Does that chill emptiness compare with the warmth of loving parents? Come to us, Belgarion, and
                accept our love."
            </p>
            <p>Garion jerked himself out of sleep, sitting bolt upright, trembling and sweating.</p>
            <p>"I need help, " he cried out silently, reaching into the vaults of his mind to find that other, nameless
                presence.
            </p>
            <p>"What's your problem now?" the dry voice asked him.</p>
            <p>"He's cheating, " Garion declared, outraged.</p>
            <p>"Cheating? Did somebody come along and make up a set of rules while I wasn't watching?"</p>
            <p>"You know what I mean. He's offering to make Aunt Pol my mother if I'll do what he says. "</p>
            <p>"He's lying. He can't alter the past. Ignore him."</p>
            <p>"How can I? He keeps reaching into my mind and putting his hand on the most sensitive spots "</p>
            <p>"Think about Ce'Nedra. That'll confuse him. "</p>
            <p>"Ce'Nedra?"</p>
            <p>"Every time he tries to tempt you with Polgara, think about your flighty little princess. Remember
                exactly how she looked when you peeked at her while she was bathing that time back in the Wood of the
                Dryads."
            </p>
            <p>"I did not peekl"</p>
            <p>"Really? How is it that you remember every single detail so vividly, then?"</p>
            <p>Garion blushed. He had forgotten that his daydreams were not entirely private.</p>
            <p>"Just concentrate on Ce'Nedra. It will probably irritate Torak almost as much as it does me. " The voice
                paused. "Is that all you can really think about?" it asked then.
            </p>
            <p>Garion did not try to answer that.</p>
            <p>They pushed on southward under the dirty overcast and two days later they reached the first trees,
                scattered sparsely at the edge of the grassland where great herds of antlered creatures grazed as
                placidly and unafraid as cattle. As the three of them rode south, the scattered clumps of trees became
                thicker, and soon spread into a forest of dark-boughed evergreens.
            </p>
            <p>The whispering blandishments of Torak continued, but Garion countered them with thoughts of his
                red-haired little princess. He could sense the irritation of his enemy each time he intruded these
                daydreams upon the carefully orchestrated images Torak kept trying to instill in his imagination. Torak
                wanted him to

            </p>
            <p>think of his loneliness and fear and of the possibility of becoming a part of a loving family, but the
                intrusion of Ce'Nedra into the picture confused and baffled the God. Garion soon perceived that Torak's
                understanding of men was severely limited. Concerned more with elementals, with those towering
                compulsions and ambitions which had inflamed him for the endless eons, Torak could not cope with the
                scattered complexities and conflicting desires that motivated most men. Garion seized on his advantage
                to thwart the insidious and compelling whispers with which Torak tried to lure him from his purpose.
            </p>
            <p>The whole business was somehow peculiarly familiar. This had happened before - not perhaps in exactly the
                same way, but very similarly. He sorted through his memories, trying to pin down this strange sense of
                repetition. It was the sight of a twisted tree stump, lightning-blasted and charred, that suddenly
                brought it all flooding back in on him. The stump, when seen from a certain angle, bore a vague
                resemblance to a man on horseback, a dark rider who seemed to watch them as they rode by. Because the
                sky was overcast, the stump cast no shadow, and the image clicked into place. Throughout his childhood,
                hovering always on the edge of his vision, Garion had seen the strange, menacing shape of a dark-cloaked
                rider on a black horse, shadowless even in the brightest sunlight. That had been Asharak the Murgo, of
                course, the Grolim whom Garion had destroyed in his first open act as a sorcerer. But had it? There had
                existed between Garion and that dark figure which had so haunted his childhood a strange bond. They had
                been enemies; Garion had always known that; but in their enmity there had always been a curious
                closeness, something that seemed to pull them together. Garion quite deliberately began to examine a
                startling possibility. Suppose that the dark rider had not in fact been Asharak - or if it had been,
                suppose that Asharak had somehow been suffused by another, more powerful awareness.
            </p>
            <p>The more he thought about it, the more convinced Garion became that he had stumbled inadvertently across
                the truth of the matter. Torak had demonstrated that, even though his body slept, his awareness could
                still move about the world, twisting events to his own purposes. Asharak had been involved, certainly,
                but the dominating force had always been the consciousness of Torak. The Dark God had stood watch over
                him since infancy. The fear he had sensed in that dark shape that had hovered always on the edge of his
                boyhood had not been Asharak's fear, but Torak's. Torak had known who he was from the beginning, had
                known that one day Garion would take up the sword of the Rivan King and come to the meeting that had
                been ordained since before the world was made.
            </p>
            <p>Acting upon a sudden impulse, Garion put his left hand inside his tunic and took hold of his amulet.</p>
            <p>Twisting slightly, he reached up and laid the marked palm of his right hand on the Orb, which stood on
                the pommel of the great sword strapped across his back.
            </p>
            <p>"I know you now, " he declared silently, hurling the thought at the murky sky. "You might as well give up
                trying to win me over to your side, because I'm not going to change my mind. Aunt Pol is not your wife,
                and I'm not your son. You'd better stop trying to play games with my thoughts and get ready, because I
                in coming to kill you. "
            </p>
            <p>The Orb beneath his hand flared with a sudden exultation as Garion threw his challenge into the Dark
                God's teeth, and the sword at Garion's back suddenly burst into a blue flame that flickered through the
                sheath enclosing it.
            </p>
            <p>There was a moment of deadly silence, and then what had been a whisper suddenly became a vast roar.</p>
            <p>"Come, then, Belgarion, Child of Light, " Torak hurled back the challenge. "I await thee in the City of
                Night. Bring all thy will and all thy courage with thee, for I am ready for our meeting."
            </p>
            <p>"What in the name of the seven Gods do you think you're doing?" Belgarath almost screamed at Garion, his
                face mottled with angry astonishment.
            </p>
            <p>"Torak's been whispering at me for almost a week now," Garion explained calmly, taking his hand from the
                Orb. "He's been offering me all kinds of things if I'd give up this whole idea. I got tired of it, so I
                told him to stop."
            </p>
            <p>Belgarath spluttered indignantly, waving his hands at Garion.</p>
            <p>"He knows I'm coming, Grandfather," Garion said, trying to placate the infuriated old man. "He's known
                who I was since the day I was born. He's been watching me all this time. We're not going to be able to
                take him by surprise, so why try? I wanted to let him know that I was on to him. Maybe it's time for him
                to start worrying and being afraid just a little bit, too."
            </p>
            <p>Silk was staring at Garion. "He's an Alorn, all right," he observed finally.</p>
            <p>"He's an idiot!" Belgarath snapped angrily. He turned back to Garion. "Did it ever occur to you that
                there might be something out here to worry about besides Torak?" he demanded.
            </p>
            <p>Garion blinked.</p>
            <p>"Cthol Mishrak is not unguarded, you young blockhead. You've just succeeded in announcing our presence to
                every Grolim within a hundred leagues."
            </p>
            <p>"I didn't think of that," Garion mumbled.</p>
            <p>"I didn't think you'd thought. Sometimes I don't think you know how to think."</p>
            <p>Silk looked around apprehensively. "Now what do we do?" he asked.</p>
            <p>"We'd better get out of here - as fast as our horses can carry us," Belgarath said. He glared at Garion.
                "Are you sure you don't have a trumpet somewhere under your clothes?" he asked with heavy sarcasm.
                "Maybe you'd like to blow a few fanfares as we go along." He shook his head in disgust and then gathered
                up his reins. "Let's ride," he said.
            </p>

        <chapter number="21">
            <p>THE ASPENS WERE stark white and motionless under the dead sky, and they rose, straight and slender, like
                the bars of an interminable cage. Belgarath led them at a walk, carefully weaving his way through the
                endless stretches of this vast, silent forest.
            </p>
            <p>"How much farther?" Silk asked the old man tensely.</p>
            <p>"Not much more than a day, now," Belgarath replied. "The clouds ahead are getting thicker."</p>
            <p>"You say the cloudbank never moves?"</p>
            <p>"Never. It's been stationary since Torak put it there."</p>
            <p>"What if a wind came along? Wouldn't that move it?"</p>
            <p>Belgarath shook his head. "The normal rules have been suspended in that region. For all I know, the cloud
                might not actually be cloud. It might be something else."
            </p>
            <p>"Like what?"</p>
            <p>"An illusion of some kind, perhaps. The Gods are very good at illusions."</p>
            <p>"Are they looking for us? The Grolims, I mean."</p>
            <p>Belgarath nodded.</p>
            <p>"Are you taking steps to keep them from finding us?"</p>
            <p>"Naturally." The old man looked at him. "Why this sudden urge for conversation? You've been talking
                steadily for the last hour."
            </p>
            <p>"I'm a little edgy," Silk admitted. "This is unfamiliar territory, and that always makes me nervous. I'm
                much more comfortable when I've got my escape routes worked out in advance."
            </p>
            <p>"Are you always ready to run?"</p>
            <p>"In my profession you have to be. What was that?"</p>
            <p>Garion heard it too. Faintly, somewhere far off behind them, there was a deeptoned baying - one animal at
                first, but soon joined by several others. "Wolves?" he suggested.
            </p>
            <p>Belgarath's face had grown bleak. "No," he replied, "not wolves." He shook his reins, and his nervous
                horse began to trot, the sound of its hoofs muffled by the rotting loam lying thick beneath the aspens.
            </p>
            <p>"What is it then, Grandfather?" Garion asked, also pushing his horse into a trot.</p>
            <p>"Torak's Hounds," Belgarath replied tersely.</p>
            <p>"Dogs?"</p>
            <p>"Not really. They're Grolims - rather specialized ones. When the Angaraks built the city, Torak decided
                that he needed something to guard the surrounding countryside. Certain Grolims volunteered to take on
                nonhuman shapes. The change was permanent."
            </p>
            <p>"I've dealt with watchdogs before," Silk said confidently.</p>
            <p>"Not like these. Let's see if we can outrun them." Belgarath didn't sound very hopeful.</p>
            <p>They pushed their horses into a gallop, weaving in and out among the tree trunks. The limbs slapped
                against their faces as they rode, and Garion raised his arm to ward them off as the three of them
                plunged on.
            </p>
            <p>They crested a low ridge and galloped down the far side. The baying behind them seemed to be closer
                now.
            </p>
            <p>Then Silk's horse stumbled, and the little man was almost thrown from his saddle.</p>
            <p>"T'his isn't working, Belgarath," he said as the old man and Garion reined in. "This ground's too
                treacherous for us to keep this pace."
            </p>
            <p>Belgarath held up his hand and listened for a moment. The deeptoned baying was definitely closer.</p>
            <p>"They're outrunning us anyway," the old man agreed.</p>
            <p>"You'd better think of something," Silk said, looking back nervously.</p>
            <p>"I'm working on it." Belgarath raised his face to sniff at the air. "Let's keep going. I just got a whiff
                of stagnant water. The area's dotted with swampy places. We might be able to hide our scent if we can
                get into a big enough patch of water."
            </p>
            <p>They moved on down the slope toward the bottom of the valley. The odor of standing water grew steadily
                stronger as they rode.
            </p>
            <p>"Just ahead." Garion pointed toward a patch of brown water intermittently visible among the white tree
                trunks.
            </p>
            <p>The swamp was quite extensive, a broad patch of reeking, oily water trapped in the bottom of a thickly
                grown basin. Dead trees thrust up out of the water, their leafless branches seeming almost tike clawed
                hands reaching up in mute supplication to the indifferent sky.
            </p>
            <p>Silk wrinkled his nose. "It stinks bad enough to hide our scent from almost anything," he said.</p>
            <p>"We'll see," Belgarath replied. "This would probably throw off an ordinary dog, but don't forget that the
                Hounds are really Grolims. They have the ability to reason, so they won't be relying on scent alone."
            </p>
            <p>They pushed their reluctant horses into the murky water and began to splash along, changing direction
                frequently, weaving in and out among the dead tree trunks. Their horses' hoofs stirred up rotting
                vegetation from the bottom, filling the air with an even more powerful stench.
            </p>
            <p>The sound of the baying Hounds drew closer, filled now with an excitement and a terrible hunger.</p>
            <p>"I think they've hit the edge of the swamp," Silk said, cocking his head to listen.</p>
            <p>There was a momentary bafflement in the baying behind them.</p>
            <p>"Grandfather!" Garion cried, reining in sharply.</p>
            <p>Directly before them, knee-deep in the brown water stood a slavering black dog-shape. It was enormous -
            </p>
            <p>fully as large as a horse, and its eyes actually burned with a malevolent green fire. Its front shoulders
                and chest were massive, and the fangs protruding from its mouth were at least a foot long, curving down
                cruelly and dripping foam.
            </p>
            <p>"We have you now," it growled, seeming almost to chew on the words as it twisted its muzzle into
                speech.
            </p>
            <p>The voice issuing from its mouth was a rasping, tearing sound.</p>
            <p>Silk's hand instantly flashed toward one of his hidden daggers.</p>
            <p>"Never mind," Belgarath told him. "It's only a projection - a shadow."</p>
            <p>"It can do that?" Silk's tone was startled.</p>
            <p>"I told you that they're Grolims."</p>
            <p>"We hunger," the fiery-eyed Hound rumbled. "I will return soon with my pack-mates, and we will feed on
                man-meat." Then the shape flickered and vanished.
            </p>
            <p>"They know where we are now." Silk's voice was alarmed. "You'd better do something, Belgarath. Can't you
                use sorcery?"
            </p>
            <p>"That would just pinpoint our location. There are other things out there as well as the Hounds."</p>
            <p>"I'd say we'll have to chance it. Let's worry about one thing at a time. Did you see those teeth?"</p>
            <p>"They're coming," Garion said tensely. From far back in the sway he could clearly hear the sound of
                splashing.
            </p>
            <p>"Do something, Belgarath!"</p>
            <p>The sky overhead had grown darker, and the air seemed suddenly oppressively heavy. From far off there was
                an angry mutter of thunder. A vast sigh seemed to pass through the forest.
            </p>
            <p>"Keep going," Belgarath said, and they splashed off through the slimy brown water toward the far side of
                the swamp. The aspen trees on the solid ground ahead of them quite suddenly turned the silvery
                undersides of their leaves upward, and it was almost as if a great, pale wave had shuddered through the
                forest.
            </p>
            <p>The Hounds were very close now, and their baying was triumphant as they plunged through the oily, reeking
                swamp.
            </p>
            <p>And then there was a brilliant blue-white flash, and a shattering clap of thunder. The sky ripped open
                above them. With a sound nearly as loud as the thunder, they were engulfed in a sudden deluge. The wind
                howled, ripping away the aspen leaves in great sheets and whirling them through the air. The rain drove
                horizontally before the sudden gale, churning the swamp to froth and obliterating everything more than a
                few feet away.
            </p>
            <p>"Did you do this?" Silk shouted at Belgarath.</p>
            <p>But Belgarath's stunned face clearly said that the storm was as much a surprise to him as to Silk. They
                both turned to look at Garion.
            </p>
            <p>"Did you do it?" Belgarath demanded.</p>
            <p>"He didn't. I did." The voice which came from Garion's mouth was not his. "I've labored too long at this
                to be thwarted by a pack of dogs."
            </p>
            <p>"I didn't hear a thing," Belgarath marveled, wiping at his streaming face. "Not even a whisper."</p>
            <p>"You were listening at the wrong time," the voice of Garion's inner companion replied. "I set it in
                motion early last spring. It's just now getting here."
            </p>
            <p>"You knew we'd need it?"</p>
            <p>"Obviously. Turn east. The Hounds won't be able to track you in all this. Swing around and come at the
                city from the east side. There are fewer watchers on that flank."
            </p>
            <p>The downpour continued, punctuated by ripping claps of thunder and flashes of lightning.</p>
            <p>"How long will the rain last?" Belgarath shouted over the noise.</p>
            <p>"Long enough. It's been building in the Sea of the East for a week. It hit the coast this morning. Turn
                east."
            </p>
            <p>"Can we talk as we ride?" Belgarath asked. "I have a great many questions."</p>
            <p>"This is hardly the time for discussion, Belgarath. You have to hurry. The others arrived at Cthol
                Mishrak this morning, just ahead of the storm. Everything's ready there, so move."
            </p>
            <p>"It's going to be tonight?"</p>
            <p>"It will, if you get there in time. Torak's almost awake now. I think you'd better be there when he opens
                his eyes."
            </p>
            <p>Belgarath wiped his streaming face again, and his eyes had a worried look. "Let's go," he said sharply
                and he led them splashing off through the driving rain to solid ground.
            </p>
            <p>The rain continued for several hours, driven before a screaming wind. Sodden, miserable, and half blinded
                by flying leaves and twigs, the three of them cantered toward the east. The baying of the Hounds trapped
                in the swamp faded behind them, taking on a baffled, frustrated note as the thunderous deluge
                obliterated all scents from the swamp and the forest.
            </p>
            <p>When night fell, they had reached a low range of hills far to the east, and the rain had subsided into a
                steady, unpleasant drizzle, punctuated by periodic squalls of chilly, gusting wind and erratic downpours
                that swept in randomly off the Sea of the East.
            </p>
            <p>"Are you sure you know the way?" Silk asked Belgarath.</p>
            <p>"I can find it," Belgarath said grimly. "Cthol Mishrak's got a peculiar smell to it."</p>
            <p>The rain slackened into a few scattered droplets pattering on the leaves overhead and died out entirely
                by the time they reached the edge of the wood. The smell of which Belgarath had spoken was not a sharp
                reek, but rather was a muted, dank compound of odors. Damp rust seemed to be a major part of it,
                although the reek of stagnant water was also present, and the musty scent of fungus. The overall effect
                was one of decay.
            </p>
            <p>When they reached the last of the trees, Belgarath reined in.</p>
            <p>"Well, there it is," he said in a quiet voice.</p>
            <p>The basin before them was faintly illuminated by a kind of pale, sickly radiance that seemed to emanate
                from the ground itself, and in the center of that large depression reared the jagged, broken remains of
                the city.
            </p>
            <p>"What's that strange light?" Garion whispered tensely.</p>
            <p>Belgarath grunted. "Phosphorescence. It comes from the fungus that grows everywhere out there. The sun
                never shines on Cthol Mishrak, so it's a natural breeding ground for unwholesome things that grow in the
                dark. We'll leave the horses here." He dismounted.
            </p>
            <p>"Is that a very good idea?" Silk asked him as he too swung down from his saddle. "We might want to leave
                in a hurry." The little man was still wet and shivering.
            </p>
            <p>"No," Belgarath said calmly. "If things go well, nothing in the city's going to be interested in giving
                us any trouble. If things don't go well, it's not going to matter anyway."
            </p>
            <p>"I don't like unalterable commitments," Silk muttered sourly.</p>
            <p>"You picked the wrong journey, then," Belgarath replied. "What we're about to do is just about as
                unalterable as things ever get. Once we start, there won't be any possible way to turn back."
            </p>
            <p>"I still don't have to like it, do I? What now?"</p>
            <p>"Garion and I are going to change into something a bit less conspicuous. You're an expert at moving about
                in the dark without being seen or heard, but we aren't that skilled at it."
            </p>
            <p>"You're going to use sorcery - this close to Torak?" Silk asked him incredulously.</p>
            <p>"We're going to be very quiet about it," Belgarath assured him. "A shape-change is directed almost
                entirely inward, so there isn't that much noise involved anyway." He turned to Garion. "We're going to
                do it slowly," he said. "That spreads out what little sound there is and makes it even fainter. Do you
                understand?"
            </p>
            <p>"I think so, Grandfather."</p>
            <p>"I'll go first. Watch me." The old man glanced at their horses. "Let's move away a bit. Horses are afraid
                of wolves. We don't want them to get hysterical and start crashing around."
            </p>
            <p>They crept along the edge of the trees until they were some distance from the horses.</p>
            <p>"This ought to be far enough," Belgarath said. "Now watch." He concentrated for a moment, and then his
                form began to shimmer and blur. The change-over was very gradual, and for several moments his face and
                the wolf's face seemed to coexist in the same place. The sound it made was only the faintest of
                whispers.
            </p>
            <p>Then it was done, and the great silver wolf sat on his haunches.</p>
            <p>"Now you do it," he told Garion with the slight change of expression that is so much a part of the speech
                of wolves.
            </p>
            <p>Garion concentrated very hard, holding the shape firmly in his mind. He did it so slowly that it seemed
                that he could actually feel the fur growing on his body.
            </p>
            <p>Silk had been rubbing dirt on his face and hands to reduce the visibility of his skin. He looked at the
                two wolves, his eyes questioning. Belgarath nodded once and led the way out onto the bare earth of the
                basin that sloped down toward the rotting ruins of Cthol Mishrak. There were other shapes moving in the
                faint light, prowling, snuffling. Some of the shapes had a dog smell to them; others smelled faintly
                reptilian.
            </p>
            <p>Grolims, robed and cowled, stood watch on various hummocks and rocks, searching the darkness with their
                eyes and their minds for intruders.
            </p>
            <p>The earth beneath Garion's paws felt dead. There was no growth, no life on this wasted heath. With Silk
                crouched low between them, the two wolves crept, belly low, toward the ruin, taking full advantage of
                rocky outcrops and eroded gullies. Their pace seemed excruciatingly slow to Garion, but Belgarath paid
                little attention to the passage of time. Occasionally, when they passed near one of the watching
                Grolims,

            </p>
            <p>they moved but one paw at a time. The minutes dragged by as they crept closer and closer to the broken
                City of Night.
            </p>
            <p>Near the shattered wall, two of the hooded priests of Torak stood in quiet conversation. Their muted
                voices fell clearly upon Garion's intensely sharpened ears.
            </p>
            <p>"The Hounds seem nervous tonight," one of them said.</p>
            <p>"The storm," the other replied. "Bad weather always makes them edgy."</p>
            <p>"I wonder what it's like to be a Hound," the first Grolim mused.</p>
            <p>"If you like, perhaps they'll let you join them."</p>
            <p>"I don't think I'm that curious."</p>
            <p>Silk and the two wolves, moving as silently as smoke, passed no more than ten yards from the two idly
                chatting guards, and crept over the fallen stones into the dead City of Night. Once among the ruins,
                they were able to move faster. The shadows concealed their movements, and they flitted among the blasted
                stones in Belgarath's wake, moving steadily toward the center of the city where the stump of the iron
                tower now reared stark and black toward the murky sky.
            </p>
            <p>The reek of rust, stagnation, and decay was much stronger, coming to Garion's wolf sharp nose in almost
                overpowering waves. It was a gagging smell, and he clamped his muzzle shut and tried not to think about
                it.
            </p>
            <p>"Who's there?" a voice came sharply from just ahead of them. A Grolim with a drawn sword stepped out into
                the rubble-strewn street, peering intently into the deep shadows where the three crouched, frozen into
                immobility. Garion sensed rather than heard or saw Silk's slow, deliberate reach toward the dagger
                sheathed at the back of his neck. Then the little man's arm swung sharply down, and his knife made a
                fluttering whistle as it sped with deadly accuracy, turning end for end as it flew.
            </p>
            <p>The Grolim grunted, doubling over sharply, then he sighed and toppled forward, his sword clanging as it
                fell.
            </p>
            <p>"Let's move!" Silk ran past the huddled form of the dead Grolim sprawled on the stones.</p>
            <p>Garion smelled fresh blood as he loped past, and the smell brought a sudden, hot taste to his mouth.</p>
            <p>They reached the massive tangle of twisted girders and crumpled plates that had been the iron tower and
                crept silently through the open doorway into the total blackness of the chamber within. The smell of
                rust was everywhere now; coupled with it was a smell of ancient, brooding evil. Garion stopped, sniffing
                nervously at the tainted air, feeling his hackles rising on his ruffed neck. With an effort, he
                suppressed the low growl that rose involuntarily in his throat.
            </p>
            <p>He felt Belgarath's shoulder brush him and he followed the old wolf, guided now by scent alone in the
                utter blackness. At the far end of the huge, empty, iron room there was another doorway.
            </p>
            <p>Belgarath stopped, and Garion felt again that faint brushing whisper as the old man slowly shifted back
                into the shape of a man. Garion clenched in his own will and let himself gradually flow back into his
                own form.
            </p>
            <p>Silk was breathing a string of colorful curses, fervent but almost inaudible.</p>
            <p>"What's the matter?" Belgarath whispered.</p>
            <p>"I forgot to stop for my knife," Silk replied, grating his teeth together. "It's one of my favorites."
            </p>
            <p>"What now, Grandfather?" Garion asked, his whisper hoarse.</p>
            <p>"Just beyond this door, there's a flight of stairs leading down."</p>
            <p>"What's at the bottom?"</p>
            <p>"A cellar. It's a sort of tomb where Zedar's got Torak's body. Shall we go down?"</p>
            <p>Garion sighed, then squared his shoulders. "I guess that's what we came for," he replied.</p>
        </chapter>
        <chapter number="22">
            <p>"YOU DON'T ACTUALLY believe I'll accept that, do you, Zedar?" Garion froze in the act of putting his hand
                on the iron door at the foot of the stairs."You can't evade your responsibility with the pretence of
                necessity," the voice beyond the door continued.
            </p>
            <p>"Aren't we all driven by necessity, Polgara?" a stranger's voice replied with a kind of weary sadness. "I
                won't say that I was blameless, but wasn't my apostacy predestined? The universe has been divided
                against itself since the beginning of time, and now the two Prophecies rush toward each other for their
                final meeting when all will be resolved. Who can say that what I have done was not essential to that
                meeting?"
            </p>
            <p>"That's an evasion, Zedar," Aunt Pol told him.</p>
            <p>"What's she doing here?" Garion whispered to Belgarath.</p>
            <p>"She's supposed to be here," Belgarath whispered back with an odd note of satisfaction. "Listen."</p>
            <p>"I don't think we'll gain anything by wrangling with each other, Polgara," Zedar the Apostate was
                saying.
            </p>
            <p>"We each believe that what we did was right. Neither of us could ever persuade the other to change sides
                at this point. Why don't we just let it go at that?"
            </p>
            <p>"Very well, Zedar," Aunt Pol replied coolly.</p>
            <p>"What now?" Silk breathed.</p>
            <p>"There should be others in there, too," Belgarath answered softly. "Let's make sure before we go bursting
                in."
            </p>
            <p>The iron door in front of them did not fit tightly, and faint light seeped through the cracks around the
                frame.
            </p>
            <p>Garion could make out Belgarath's intent face in that dim light.</p>
            <p>"How's your father?" Zedar asked in a neutral tone.</p>
            <p>"About the same as always. He's very angry with you, you know."</p>
            <p>"That was to be expected, I suppose."</p>
            <p>"He's finished eating, Lady Polgara," Garion heard Ce'Nedra say. He looked sharply at Belgarath, but the
                old man put one finger to his lips.
            </p>
            <p>"Spread one of those pallets out for him, dear," Aunt Pol instructed, "and cover him with some blankets.
                It's very late, and he's sleepy."
            </p>
            <p>"I'll do that," Durnik offered.</p>
            <p>"Good," Belgarath breathed. "They're all here."</p>
            <p>"How did they get here?" Silk whispered.</p>
            <p>"I haven't the faintest idea, and I'm not going to worry about it. The important thing is that they're
                here."
            </p>
            <p>"I'm glad you were able to rescue him from Ctuchik," Zedar said. "I grew rather fond of him during the
                years we spent together."
            </p>
            <p>"Where did you find him?" Aunt Pol asked. "We've never been able to pin down what country he's from."</p>
            <p>"I forgot precisely," Zedar answered, and his voice was faintly troubled. "Perhaps it was Camaar or Tol
                Honeth or maybe some city on the other side of Mallorea. The details keep slipping away from me almost
                as if I weren't supposed to examine them too closely."
            </p>
            <p>"Try to remember," she said. "It might be important."</p>
            <p>Zedar sighed. "If it amuses you," he said. He paused as if thinking. "I'd grown restless for some
                reason," he began. "It was - oh, fifty or sixty years ago. My studies no longer interested me, and the
                bickering of the various Grolim factions began to irritate me. I took to wandering about - not really
                paying much attention to where I was. I must have crossed and crisscrossed the Kingdoms of the West and
                the Angarak Kingdoms a half dozen times in those years.
            </p>
            <p>"Anyway, I was passing through some city somewhere when the idea struck me all at once. We all know that
                the Orb will destroy anyone who touches it with the slightest trace of evil in his heart, but what would
                it do to someone who touched it in total innocence? I was stunned by the simplicity of the idea. The
                street I was on was full of people, and I needed quiet to consider this remarkable idea, so I turned a
                corner into some forgotten alley, and there the child was - almost as if he'd been waiting for me. He
                seemed to be about two years old at the time - old enough to walk and not much more. I held out my hand
                to him and said, 'I have a little errand for you, my boy.' He came to me and repeated the word,
                'Errand.' It's the only word I've ever heard him say."
            </p>
            <p>"What did the Orb do when he first touched it?" Aunt Pol asked him. "It flickered. In some peculiar way
                it seemed to recognize him, and something seemed to pass between them when he laid his hand on it." He
                sighed. "No, Polgara, I don't know who the child is - or even what he is. For all I know, he may even be
                an illusion. The idea to use him in the first place came to me so suddenly that I sometimes wonder if
                perhaps it was placed in my mind. It's entirely possible, I suppose, that I didn't find him, but that he
                found me. " He fell silent again.
            </p>
            <p>There was a long pause on the other side of the iron door.</p>
            <p>"Why, Zedar?" Aunt Pol asked him very quietly. "Why did you betray our Master?" Her voice was strangely
                compassionate.
            </p>
            <p>"To save the Orb," he replied sadly. "At least, at first that was the idea. From the moment I first saw
                it, it owned me. After Torak took it from our Master, Belgarath and the others began making their plans
                to regain it by force, but I knew that if Aldur himself did not join his hand with theirs to strike
                directly at Torak, they would fail - and Aldur would not do that. I reasoned that if force must fail,
                then guile might succeed. I thought that by pretending allegiance to Torak, I might gain his confidence
                and steal it back from him."
            </p>
            <p>"What happened, Zedar?" Her question was very direct. There was another long, painful pause.</p>
            <p>"Oh, Polgara!" Zedar's voice came in a strangled sob. "You cannot know! I was so sure of myself - so
                certain that I could keep a part of my mind free from Torak's domination - but I was wrong - wrong! His
                mind and will overwhelm me. He took me in his hand and he crushed out all of my resistance. The touch of
                his hand, Polgara!" There was horror in Zedar's voice. "It reaches down into the very depths of your
                soul. I know Torak for what he is - loathsome, twisted, evil beyond your understanding of the word - but
                when he calls me, I must go; and what he bids me do, I must do - even though my soul shrieks within me
                against it.
            </p>
            <p>Even now, as he sleeps, his fist is around my heart." There was another hoarse sob.</p>
            <p>"Didn't you know that it's impossible to resist a God?" Aunt Pol asked in that same compassionate
                voice.
            </p>
            <p>"Was it pride, Zedar? Were you so sure of your power that you thought you could trick him - that you
                could conceal your intention from him?"
            </p>
            <p>Zedar sighed. "Perhaps," he admitted. "Aldur was a gentle Master. He never brought his mind down on me,
                so I was not prepared for what Torak did to me. Torak is not gentle. What he wants, he takes - and if he
                must rip out your soul in the taking, it does not matter to him in the slightest. You'll discover his
                power, Polgara. Soon he'll awaken and he'll destroy Belgarion. Not even the Rivan King is a match for
                that awful mind. And then Torak will take you as his bride - as he has always said he would. Don't
                resist him, Polgara.
            </p>
            <p>Save yourself that agony. In the end, you'll go to him anyway. You'll go willingly - even eagerly."</p>
            <p>There was a sudden scraping sound in the room beyond the iron door, and a quick rush of feet.</p>
            <p>"Durnik!" Aunt Pol cried sharply. "No!"</p>
            <p>"What's happening?" Garion demanded of Belgarath.</p>
            <p>"That's what it means!" Belgarath gasped. "Get that door open!"</p>
            <p>"Get back, you fool!" Zedar was shouting.</p>
            <p>There was a sudden crash, the sound of bodies locked in struggle smashing into furniture.</p>
            <p>"I warn you," Zedar cried again. "Get back!"</p>
            <p>There was the sharp sound of a blow, of a fist striking solid bone.</p>
            <p>"Zedar!" Belgarath roared, yanking at the iron door.</p>
            <p>Then within the room there was a thunderous detonation.</p>
            <p>"Durnik!" Aunt Pol shrieked.</p>
            <p>In a sudden burst of fury, Belgarath raised his clenched hand, joined his flaming will with his arm and
                drove his fist at the locked door. The massive force of his blow ripped the iron door from its hinges as
                if it had been no more than paper.
            </p>
            <p>The room beyond had a vaulted, curved ceiling supported by great iron girders, black with age. Garion
                seemed to see everything in the room at once with a curious kind of detachment, as if all emotion had
                been drained from him. He saw Ce'Nedra and Errand clinging to each other in fright beside one wall. Aunt
                Pol was standing as if locked in place, her eyes wide as she stared in stunned disbelief at the still
                form of Durnik the smith, who lay crumpled on the floor, and whose face had that deadly pale cast to it
                that could only mean one thing. A terrible flood of realization suddenly swept her face - a realization
                of an irrevocable loss.
            </p>
            <p>"No!" she cried out. "My Durnik - No!"</p>
            <p>She rushed to the fallen man, fell on her knees beside him and gathered his still form into her arms with
                a heartbroken wail of grief and despair.
            </p>
            <p>And then Garion saw Zedar the Apostate for the first time. The sorcerer was also staring at Durnik's
                body.
            </p>
            <p>There was a desperate regret on his face - a knowledge that he had finally committed the one act that
                forever put him past all hope of redemption.
            </p>
            <p>"You fool," he muttered. "Why? Why did you make me kill you? That's the one thing above all others I
                didn't want to do."
            </p>
            <p>Then Belgarath, as inexorable as death itself, lunged through the shattered remains of the door and
                rushed upon the man he had once called brother.
            </p>
            <p>Zedar flinched back from the old sorcerer's awful rage.</p>
            <p>"I didn't mean to do it, Belgarath," he quavered, his hands raised to ward off Belgarath's rush. "The
                fool tried to attack me. He was-"
            </p>
            <p>"You-" Belgarath grated at him from between teeth clenched with hate. "You - you -" But he was past
                speech. No word could contain his rage. He raised both arms and struck at Zedar's face with his fists.
                Zedar reeled back, but Belgarath was upon him, grappling, pounding at him with his hands.
            </p>
            <p>Garion could feel flickers of will from one or the other of them; but caught up in emotions so powerful
                that they erased thought, neither was coherent enough to focus the force within him. And so, like two
                tavern brawlers, they rolled on the floor, kicking, gouging, pounding at each other, Belgarath consumed
                with fury and Zedar with fear and chagrin.
            </p>
            <p>Desperately, the Apostate jerked a dagger from the sheath at his waist, and Belgarath seized his wrist in
                both hands and pounded it on the floor until the knife went skittering away. Then each struggled to
                reach the dagger, clawing and jerking at each other, their faces frozen into intense grimaces as each
                strove to reach the dagger first.
            </p>
            <p>At some point during the frenzied seconds when they had burst into the room, Garion had, unthinking,
                drawn the great sword from its sheath across his back, but the Orb and the blade were cold and
                unresponsive in his hand as he stood watching the deadly struggle between the two sorcerers.
            </p>
            <p>Belgarath's hands were locked about Zedar's throat, and Zedar, strangling, clawed desperately at the old
                man's arms. Belgarath's face was contorted into an animal snarl, his lips drawn back from clenched teeth
                as he throttled his ancient enemy. As if finally driven past all hope of sanity, he struggled to his
                feet, dragging

            </p>
            <p>Zedar up with him. Holding the Apostate by the throat with one hand, he began to rain blows on him with
                the other. Then, between one blow and the next, he swung his arm down and pointed at the stones beneath
                their feet. With a dreadful grinding, a great crack appeared, zigzagging across the floor. The rocks
                shrieked in protest as the crack widened. Still struggling, the two men toppled and fell into the
                yawning fissure. The earth seemed to shudder. With a terrible sound, the crack ground shut.
            </p>
            <p>Incredulously, his mouth suddenly agape, Garion stared in stunned disbelief at the scarcely discernible
                crack through which the two men had fallen.
            </p>
            <p>Ce'Nedra screamed, her hands going to her face in horror.</p>
            <p>"Do something!" Silk shouted at Garion, but Garion could only stare at him in blank incomprehension.</p>
            <p>"Polgara!" Silk said desperately, turning to Aunt Pol.</p>
            <p>Still incapacitated by her sudden, overwhelming grief, she could not respond, but knelt with Durnik's
                lifeless body in her arms, weeping uncontrollably as she rocked back and forth, holding him tightly
                against her.
            </p>
            <p>From infinitely far beneath there was a sullen detonation, and then another. Even in the bowels of the
                earth, the deadly struggle continued. As if compelled, Garion's eyes sought out the embrasure in the far
                wall; there in the dim light he could make out the recumbent form of Kal Torak. Strangely emotionless,
                Garion stared at the form of his enemy, meticulously noting every detail. He saw the black robe and the
                polished mask. And he saw Cthrek Goru, Torak's great black sword.
            </p>
            <p>Although he did not - could not - move or even feel, a struggle, nonetheless, raged inside him - a
                struggle perhaps even more dreadful than that which had just plunged Belgarath and Zedar into the depths
                of the earth. The two forces which had first diverged and then turned and rushed at each other down the
                endless corridors of time had finally met within him. The EVENT which was the ultimate conclusion of the
                two Prophecies, had begun, and its first skirmishes were taking place within Garion's mind. Minute and
                very subtle adjustments were shifting some of his most deeply ingrained attitudes and perceptions.
            </p>
            <p>Torak moved, stirring restlessly, as those same two forces met within him.</p>
            <p>Dreadful flashes of the sleeping God's mind assailed Garion, and he saw clearly the terrible subterfuge
                that lay behind Torak's offer of friendship and love. Had his fear of their duel drawn him into
                yielding, fully half of creation would have shimmered and vanished. More than that, what Torak had
                offered was not love but an enslavement so vile that it was beyond imagining.
            </p>
            <p>But he had not yielded. He had somehow evaded the overwhelming force of Torak's mind and had placed
                himself utterly in the hands of the Prophecy that had drawn him here. With an absolute denial of self,
                he had become the instrument of the Prophecy. He was no longer afraid. Sword in hand, the Child of Light
                awaited the moment when the Prophecy would release him to join in deadly struggle with the Dark God.
            </p>
            <p>Then, even as Silk desperately tried to arouse either Garion or Polgara to action, the stones of the
                floor buckled upward, and Belgarath rose from the earth.
            </p>
            <p>Garion, still abstracted and bemused, saw that all traces of the sometimes foolish old man he had known
                before were gone. The thieving old storyteller had vanished. Even the irritable old man who had led the
                quest for the Orb no longer existed. In their place stood the form of Belgarath the sorcerer, the
                Eternal Man, shimmering in the aura of his full power.
            </p>
        </chapter>
        <chapter number="23">
            <p>"WHERE IS ZEDAR?" Aunt Pol asked, raising her tearstreaked face from Durnik's lifeless body to stare with
                a dreadful intensity at her father.
            </p>
            <p>"I left him down there," Belgarath replied bleakly.</p>
            <p>"Dead?"</p>
            <p>"No."</p>
            <p>"Bring him back."</p>
            <p>"Why?"</p>
            <p>"To face me." Her eyes burned.</p>
            <p>The old man shook his head. "No, Pol," he said to her. "You've never killed anyone. Let's leave it that
                way."
            </p>
            <p>She gently lowered Durnik's body to the floor and rose to her feet, her pale face twisted with grief and
                an awful need. "Then I will go to him," she declared, raising both arms as if to strike at the earth
                beneath her feet.
            </p>
            <p>"No," Belgarath told her, extending his own hand, "you will not. "</p>
            <p>They stood facing each other, locked in a dreadful, silent struggle. Aunt Pol's look at first was one of
                annoyance at her father's interference. She raised one arm again to bring the force of her will crashing
                down at the earth, but once again Belgarath put forth his hand.
            </p>
            <p>"Let me go, father."</p>
            <p>"No."</p>
            <p>She redoubled her efforts, twisting as if trying to free herself from his unseen restraint. "Let me go,
                old man," she cried.
            </p>
            <p>"No. Don't do this, Pol. I don't want to hurt you."</p>
            <p>She tried again, more desperately this time, but once again Belgarath smothered her will with his. His
                face hardened, and he set his jaw.
            </p>
            <p>In a last effort, she flung the whole force of her mind against the barrier he had erected. Like some
                great rock, however, the old man remained firm. Finally her shoulders slumped, and she turned, knelt
                beside Durnik's body, and began to weep again.
            </p>
            <p>"I'm sorry, Pol," he said gently. "I never wanted to have to do that. Are you all right?"</p>
            <p>"How can you ask that?" she demanded brokenly, wringing her hands over Durnik's silent body.</p>
            <p>"That's not what I meant."</p>
            <p>She turned her back on him and buried her face in her hands.</p>
            <p>"I don't think you could have reached him anyway, Pol," the old man told her. "You know as well as I that
                what one of us does, another cannot undo."
            </p>
            <p>Silk, his ferretlike face shocked, spoke in a hushed voice. "What did you do to him?"</p>
            <p>"I took him down until we came to solid rock. And then I sealed him up in it."</p>
            <p>"Can't he just come up out of the earth the way you did?"</p>
            <p>"No. That's impossible for him now. Sorcery is thought, and no man can exactly duplicate the thought of
                another. Zedar's imprisoned inside the rock forever - or until I choose to free him." The old man looked
                mournfully at Durnik's body. "And I don't think I'll choose to do that."
            </p>
            <p>"He'll die, won't he?" Silk asked.</p>
            <p>Belgarath shook his head. "No. That was part of what I did to him. He'll lie inside the rock until the
                end of days."
            </p>
            <p>"That's monstrous, Belgarath," Silk said in a sick voice.</p>
            <p>"So was that," Belgarath replied grimly, pointing at Durnik.</p>
            <p>Garion could hear what they were saying and could see them all quite clearly, but it seemed somehow that
                they were actually someplace else. The others in the underground crypt seemed to be on the periphery of
                his attention. For him there was only one other in the vaulted chamber, and that other was Kal Torak,
                his enemy.
            </p>
            <p>The restless stirring of the drowsing God became more evident. Garion's peculiarly multiple awareness -
                in part his own, in part derived from the Orb, and as ever overlaid by the consciousness which he had
                always called the dry voice in his mind - perceived in that stirnng the pain that lay beneath the maimed
                God's movements. Torak was actually writhing as he half slept. An injured man would heal in time, and
                his pain would gradually diminish and ultimately disappear, because injury was a part of the human
                condition. A man was born to be hurt from time to time, and the mechanism for recovery was born with
                him. A God, on the other hand, was invulnerable, and he had no need for the ability to heal. Thus it was
                with Torak. The fire which the Orb had loosed upon him when he had used it to crack the world still
                seared his flesh, and his pain had not diminished in the slightest down through all the endless
                centuries since his maiming. Behind that steel mask, the flesh of the Dragon-God's face still smoked,
                and his burned eye still boiled endlessly in its socket. Garion shuddered, almost pitying that perpetual
                agony.
            </p>
            <p>The child, Errand, pulled himself free from Ce'Nedra's trembling arms and crossed the flagstone floor of
                the tomb, his small face intent. He stopped, bent and put his hand on Durnik's shoulder. Gently he shook
                the dead man as if trying to wake him. His little face became puzzled when the smith did not respond. He
                shook again, a bit harder, his eyes uncomprehending.
            </p>
            <p>"Errand," Ce'Nedra called to him, her voice breaking, "come back. There's nothing we can do."</p>
            <p>Errand looked at her, then back at Durnik. Then he gently patted the smith's shoulder with a peculiar
                little gesture, sighed, and went back to the princess. She caught him suddenly in her arms and began to
                weep,
            </p>
            <p>burying her face against his small body. Once again with that same curious little gesture, he patted her
                flaming hair.
            </p>
            <p>Then from the alcove in the far wall there came a long, rasping sigh, a shuddering expiration of
                breath.
            </p>
            <p>Garion looked sharply toward the alcove, his hand tightening on the hilt of his cold sword. Torak had
                turned his head, and his eyes were open. The hideous fire burned in the eye that was not as the God came
                awake.
            </p>
            <p>Belgarath drew in his breath in a sharp hiss as Torak raised the charred stump of his left hand as if to
                brush away the last of his sleep, even as his right hand groped for the massive hilt of Cthrek Goru, his
                black sword. "Garion!" Belgarath said sharply.
            </p>
            <p>But Garion, still locked in stasis by the forces focusing upon him, could only stare at the awakening
                God. A part of him struggled to shake free, and his hand trembled as he fought to lift his sword.
            </p>
            <p>"Not yet," the voice whispered.</p>
            <p>"Garion!" Belgarath actually shouted this time. Then, in a move seemingly born of desperation, the old
                sorcerer lunged past the bemused young man to fling himself upon the still recumbent form of the Dark
                God.
            </p>
            <p>Torak's hand released the hilt of his sword and almost contemptuously grasped the front of Belgarath's
                tunic, lifting the struggling old man from him as one might lift a child. The steel mask twisted into an
                ugly sneer as the God held the helpless sorcerer out from him. Then, like a great wind, the force of
                Torak's mind struck, hurling Belgarath across the room, ripping away the front of his tunic. Something
                glittered across Torak's knuckles, and Garion realized that it was the silver chain of Belgarath's
                amulet-the polished medallion of the standing wolf. In a very peculiar way the medallion had always been
                the center of Belgarath's power, and now it lay in the grip of his ancient enemy.
            </p>
            <p>With a dreadfully slow deliberation, the Dark God rose from his bier, towering over all of them, Cthrek
                Goru in his hand.
            </p>
            <p>"Garion!" Ce'Nedra screamed. "Do something!"</p>
            <p>With deadly pace Torak strode toward the dazed Belgarath, raising his sword. But Aunt Pol sprang to her
                feet and threw herself between them.
            </p>
            <p>Slowly Torak lowered his sword, and then he smiled a loathsome smile. "My bride," he rasped in a horrid
                voice.
            </p>
            <p>"Never, Torak," she declared.</p>
            <p>He ignored her defiance. "Thou hast come to me at last, Polgara," he gloated.</p>
            <p>"I have come to watch you die."</p>
            <p>"Die, Polgara? Me? No, my bride, that is not why thou hast come. My will has drawn thee to me as was
                foretold. And now thou art mine. Come to me, my beloved."
            </p>
            <p>"Never!"</p>
            <p>"Never, Polgara?" There was a dreadful insinuation in the God's rasping voice. "Thou wilt submit to me,
                my bride. I will bend thee to my will. Thy struggles shall but make my victory over thee the sweeter. In
                the end, I will have thee. Come here."
            </p>
            <p>So overwhelming was the force of his mind that she swayed almost as a tree sways in the grip of a great
                wind. "No," she gasped, closing her eyes and turning her face away sharply.
            </p>
            <p>"Look at me, Polgara," he commanded, his voice almost purring. "I am thy fate. All that thou didst think
                to love before me shall fall away, and thou shall love only me. Look at me."
            </p>
            <p>Helplessly she turned her head and opened her eyes to stare at him. The hatred and defiance seemed to
                melt out of her, and a terrible fear came into her face.
            </p>
            <p>"Thy will crumbles, my beloved," he told her. "Now come to me."</p>
            <p>She must resist! All the confusion was gone now, and Garion understood at last. Thts was the real battle.
                If Aunt Pol succumbed, they were all lost. It had all been for this.
            </p>
            <p>"Help her, " the voice within him said.</p>
            <p>"Aunt Poll" Garion threw the thought at her, "Remember Durnik!"</p>
            <p>He knew without knowing how he knew that this was the one thing that could sustain her in her deadly
                struggle. He ranged through his memory, throwing images of Durnik at her - of the smith's strong hands
                at work at his forge - of his serious eyes - of the quiet sound of his voice - and most of all of the
                good man's unspoken love for her, the love that had been the center of Durnik's entire life.
            </p>
            <p>She had begun involuntarily to move, no more than a slight shifting of her weight in preparation for that
                first fatal step in response to Torak's overpowering command. Once she had made that step, she would be
                lost. But Garion's memories of Durnik struck her like a blow. Her shoulders, which had already begun to
                droop in defeat, suddenly straightened, and her eyes flashed with renewed defiance.
            </p>
            <p>"Never!" she told the expectantly waiting God. "I will not!"</p>
            <p>Torak's face slowly stiffened. His eyes blazed as he brought the full, crushing force of his will to bear
                upon her, but she stood firmly against all that he could do, clinging to the memory of Durnik as if to
                something so solid that not even the will of the Dark God could tear her from it.
            </p>
            <p>A look of baffled frustration contorted Torak's face as he perceived that she would never yield - that
                her love would be forever denied to him. She had won, and her victory was like a knife twisting slowly
                inside him. Thwarted, enraged, maddened by her now-unalterable will to resist, Torak raised his face and
                suddenly howled - a shocking, animallike sound of overwhelming frustration.
            </p>
            <p>"Then perish both!" he raged. "Die with thy father!"</p>
            <p>And with that, he once more raised his deadly sword.</p>
            <p>Unflinching, Aunt Pol faced the raging God.</p>
            <p>"Now, Belgarionl" The voice cracked in Garion's mind.</p>
            <p>The Orb, which had remained cold and dead throughout all the dreadful confrontation between Aunt Pol and
                the maimed God, suddenly flared into life, and the sword of the Rivan King exploded into fire, filling
                the crypt with an intense blue light. Garion leaped forward, extending his sword to catch the deadly
                blow which was already descending upon Aunt Pol's unprotected face.
            </p>
            <p>The steel sound of blade against blade was like the striking of a great bell, and it rang within the
                crypt, shimmering and echoing from the walls. Torak's sword, deflected by the flaming blade, plowed a
                shower of sparks from the flagstone floor. The God's single eye widened as he recognized all in one
                glance the Rivan King, the flaming sword and the blazing Orb of Aldur. Garion saw in the look that Torak
                had already forgotten Aunt Pol and that now the maimed God's full attention was focused on him.
            </p>
            <p>"And so thou hast come at last, Belgarion," the God greeted him gravely. "I have awaited thy coming since
                the beginning of days. Thy fate awaits thee here. Hail, Belgarion, and farewell."
            </p>
            <p>His arm lashed back, and he swung a vast blow, but Garion, without even thinking, raised his own sword
                and once again the crypt rang with the bell note of blade against blade.
            </p>
            <p>"Thou art but a boy, Belgarion," Torak said. "Wilt thou pit thyself against the might and invincible will
                of a God? Submit to me, and I will spare thy life."
            </p>
            <p>The will of the God of Angarak was now directed at him, and in that instant, Garion fully understood how
                hard Aunt Pol's struggle had been. He felt the terrible compulsion to obey draining the strength from
                him.
            </p>
            <p>But suddenly a vast chorus of voices rang down through all the centuries to him, crying out the single
                word,
            </p>
            <p>"No!" All the lives of all who preceded him had been directed at this one moment, and those lives infused
                him now. Though he alone held Iron-grip's sword, Belgarion of Riva was not alone, and Torak's will could
                not sway him.
            </p>
            <p>In a move of absolute defiance, Garion again raised his flaming sword.</p>
            <p>"So be it, then," Torak roared. "To the death, Belgarion!"</p>
            <p>At first it seemed but some trick of the flickering light that filled the tomb, but almost as soon as
                that thought occurred, Garion saw that Torak was growing larger, swelling upward, towering, expanding.
                With an awful wrenching sound, he shouldered aside the rusted iron roof of the tomb, bursting upward.
            </p>
            <p>Once again without thinking, without even stopping to consider how to do it, Garion also began to expand,
                and he too exploded through the confining ceiling, shuddering away the rusty debris as he rose.
            </p>
            <p>In open air among the decaying ruins of the City of Night the two titanic adversaries faced each other
                beneath the perpetual cloud that blotted out the sky.
            </p>
            <p>"The conditions are met," the dry voice spoke through Garion's lips.</p>
            <p>"So it would seem," another, equally unemotional voice came from Torak's steel-encased mouth.</p>
            <p>"Do you wish to involve others?" Garion's voice asked.</p>
            <p>"It hardly seems necessary. These two have sufficient capacity for what must be brought to bear upon
                them."
            </p>
            <p>"Then let it be decided here."</p>
            <p>"Agreed."</p>
            <p>And with that Garion felt a sudden release as all constraint was removed from him. Torak, also released,
                raised Cthrek Goru, his lips drawn back in a snarl of hate.
            </p>
            <p>Their struggle was immense. Rocks shattered beneath the colossal force of deflected blows. The sword of
                the Rivan King danced in blue flames, and Cthrek Goru, Torak's blade of shadows, swept a visible
                darkness with it at every blow. Beyond thought, beyond any emotion but blind hatred, the two swung and
                parried and lurched through the broken ruins, crushing all beneath them. The elements themselves erupted
                as the fight continued. The wind shrieked through the rotting city, tearing at the trembling stones.
                Lightning seethed about them, glaring and flickering. The earth rumbled and shook beneath their massive
                feet. The featureless cloud that had concealed the City of Night beneath its dark mantle for five
                millenia began to boil and race above them. Great patches of stars appeared and disappeared in the
                roiling middle of the surging cloud. The Grolims, both human and nonhuman, aghast at the towering
                struggle that had suddenly erupted in their very midst, fled shrieking in terror.
            </p>
            <p>Garion's blows were directed at Torak's blind side, and the Dark God flinched from the fire of the Orb
                each time the flaming sword struck, but the shadow of Cthrek Goru put a deathly chill into Garion's
                blood each time it passed over him.
            </p>
            <p>They were more evenly matched than Garion had imagined possible. Torak's advantage of size had been
                erased when they had both swelled into immensity, and Garion's inexperience was offset by Torak's
                maiming.
            </p>
            <p>It was the uneven ground that betrayed Garion. Retreating before a sudden flurry of massive blows, he
                felt one heel catch on a heap of tumbled rock, and the rotten stones crumbled and rolled beneath his
                feet.
            </p>
            <p>Despite his scrambling attempt to keep his balance, he fell.</p>
            <p>Torak's single eye blazed in triumph as he raised the dark sword. But, seizing his sword hilt in both
                hands, Garion raised his burning blade to meet that vast blow. When the swords struck, edge to edge, a
                huge shower of sparks cascaded down over Garion.
            </p>
            <p>Again Torak raised Cthrek Goru, but a strange hunger flickered across his steel-encased face.</p>
            <p>"Yield!" he roared.</p>
            <p>Garion stared up at the huge form towering over him, his mind racing.</p>
            <p>"I have no wish to kill thee, boy," Torak said, almost pleading. "Yield and I will spare thy life."</p>
            <p>And then Garion understood. His enemy was not trying to kill him, but was striving instead to force him
                to submit. Torak's driving need was for domination! This was where the real struggle between them lay!
            </p>
            <p>"Throw down thy sword, Child of Light, and bow before me," the God commanded, and the force of his mind
                was like a crushing weight.
            </p>
            <p>"I will not," Garion gasped, wrenching away from that awful compulsion. "You may kill me, but I will not
                yield."
            </p>
            <p>Torak's face twisted as if his perpetual agony had been doubled by Garion's refusal.</p>
            <p>"Thou must, " he almost sobbed. "Thou art helpless before me. Submit to me."</p>
            <p>"No!" Garion shouted, and, taking advantage of Torak's chagrin at that violent rejection, he rolled out
                from under the shadow of Cthrek Goru and sprang to his feet. Everything was clear now, and he knew at
                last how he could win.
            </p>
            <p>"Hear me, maimed and despised God," he grated from between clenched teeth. "You are nothing. Your people
                fear you, but they do not love you. You tried to deceive me into loving you; you tried to force Aunt Pol
                to love you; but I refuse you even as she did. You're a God, but you are nothing. In all the universe
                there is not one person - not one thing - that loves you. You are alone and empty, and even if you kill
                me, I will still win. Unloved and despised, you will howl out your miserable life to the end of days."
            </p>
            <p>Garion's words struck the maimed God like blows, and the Orb, as if echoing those words, blazed anew,
                lashing at the Dragon-God with its consuming hatred. This was the EVENT for which the Universe had
                waited since the beginning of time. This was why Garion had come to this decaying ruin - not to fight
                Torak, but to reject him.
            </p>
            <p>With an animal howl of anguish and rage, the Child of Dark raised Cthrek Goru above his head and ran at
                the Rivan King. Garion made no attempt to ward off the blow, but gripped the hilt of his flaming sword
                in both hands and, extending his blade before him, he lunged at his charging enemy.
            </p>
            <p>It was so easy. The sword of the Rivan King slid into Torak's chest like a stick into water, and as it
                ran into the God's suddenly stiffening body, the power of the Orb surged up the flaring blade.
            </p>
            <p>Torak's vast hand opened convulsively, and Cthrek Goru tumbled harmlessly from his grip. He opened his
                mouth to cry out, and blue flame gushed like blood from his mouth. He clawed at his face, ripping away
                the polished steel mask to reveal the hideously maimed features that had lain beneath. Tears started
                from his eyes, both the eye that was and the eye that was not, but the tears were also fire, for the
                sword of the Rivan King buried in his chest filled him with its flame.
            </p>
            <p>He lurched backward. With a steely slither, the sword slid out of his body. But the fire the blade had
                ignited within him did not go out. He clutched at the gaping wound, and blue flame spurted out between
                his fingers, spattering in little burning pools among the rotting stones about him.
            </p>
            <p>His maimed face, still streaked with fiery tears, contorted in agony. He lifted that burning face to the
                heaving sky and raised his vast arms. In mortal anguish, the stricken God cried to heaven, "Mother!" and
                the sound of his voice echoed from the farthest star.
            </p>
            <p>He stood so for a frozen moment, his arms upraised in supplication, and then he tottered and fell dead at
                Garion's feet.
            </p>
            <p>For an instant there was absolute silence. Then a howling cry started at Torak's dead lips, fading into
                unimaginable distance as the dark Prophecy fled, taking the inky shadow of Cthrek Goru with it.
            </p>
            <p>Again there was silence. The racing clouds overhead stopped in their mad plunge, and the stars that had
                appeared among the tatters of that cloud went out. The entire universe shuddered - and stopped. There
                was a moment of absolute darkness as all light everywhere went out and all motion ceased. In that
                dreadful instant all that existed - all that had been, all that was, all that was yet to be was wrenched
                suddenly into the course of one Prophecy. Where there had always been two, there was now but one.
            </p>
            <p>And then, faint at first, the wind began to blow, purging away the rotten stink of the City of Night, and
                the stars came on again like suddenly reilluminated jewels on the velvety throat of night. As the light
                returned, Garion stood wearily over the body of the God he had just killed. His sword still flickered
                blue in his hand, and the Orb exulted in the vaults of his mind. Vaguely he was aware that in that
                shuddering moment when

            </p>
            <p>all light had died, both he and Torak had returned to their normal size, but he was too tired to wonder
                about it.
            </p>
            <p>From the shattered tomb not far away, Belgarath emerged, shaken and drawn. The broken chain of his
                medallion dangled from his tightly clenched hand, and he stopped to stare for a moment at Garion and the
                fallen God.
            </p>
            <p>The wind moaned in the shattered ruins, and somewhere, far off in the night, the Hounds of Torak howled a
                mournful dirge for their fallen master.
            </p>
            <p>Belgarath straightened his shoulders; then, in a gesture peculiarly like that which Torak had made in the
                moment of his death, he raised his arms to the sky.
            </p>
            <p>"Master!" he cried out in a huge voice. "It is finished!"</p>
        </chapter>
        <chapter number="24">
            <p>IT WAS OVER, but there was a bitterness in the taste of Garion's victory. A man did not lightly kill a
                God, no matter how twisted or evil the God might be. And so Belgarion of Riva stood sadly over the body
                of his fallen enemy as the wind, smelling faintly of the approaching dawn, washed over the decaying
                ruins of the City of Night.
            </p>
            <p>"Regrets, Garion?" Belgarath asked quietly, putting his hand on his grandson's shoulder.</p>
            <p>Garion sighed. "No, Grandfather," he said. "I suppose not - not really. It had to be done, didn't it?"
            </p>
            <p>Belgarath nodded gravely.</p>
            <p>"It's just that he was so alone at the end. I took everything away from him before I killed him. I'm not
                very proud of that."
            </p>
            <p>"As you say, it had to be done. It was the only way you could beat him."</p>
            <p>"I just wish I could have left him something, that's all."</p>
            <p>From the ruins of the shattered iron tower, a sad little procession emerged. Aunt Pol, Silk, and Ce'Nedra
                were bringing out the body of Durnik the smith, and walking gravely beside them came Errand.
            </p>
            <p>A pang of almost unbearable grief ran through Garion. Durnik, his oldest friend, was pale and dead, and
                in that vast internal upheaval that had preceded the duel with Torak, Garion had not even been able to
                mourn.
            </p>
            <p>"It was necessary, you understand," Belgarath said sadly.</p>
            <p>"Why? Why did Durnik have to die, Grandfather?" Garion's voice was anguished, and tears stood openly in
                his eyes.
            </p>
            <p>"Because his death gave your Aunt the will to resist Torak. That's always been the one flaw in the
                Prophecy
            </p>
            <p>- the possibility that Pol might yield. All Torak needed was one person to love him. It would have made
                him invincible."
            </p>
            <p>"What would have happened if she had gone to him?"</p>
            <p>"You'd have lost the fight. That's why Durnik had to die." The old man sighed regretfully. "I wish it
                could have been otherwise, but it was inevitable."
            </p>
            <p>The three who had borne Durnik from the broken tomb gently laid his still form on the ground, and
                Ce'Nedra sadly joined Belgarath and Garion. Wordlessly, the tiny girl slipped her hand into Garion's,
                and the three of them stood, silently watching as Aunt Pol, past tears now, gently straightened Durnik's
                arms at his sides and then covered him with her cloak. She sat then upon the earth, took his head into
                her lap and almost absently stoked his hair, her head bowed over his in her grief.
            </p>
            <p>"I can't bear it," Ce'Nedra suddenly sobbed, and she buried her face in Garion's shoulder and began to
                weep.
            </p>
            <p>And then there was light where there had been only darkness before. As Garion stared, a single beam of
                brilliant blue light descended from the broken and tattered cloud rolling overhead. The entire ruin
                seemed bathed in its intense radiance as the light touched the earth. Like a great, glowing column, the
                beam of light reached down to the earth from the night sky, was joined by other beams, red and yellow
                and green and shades Garion could not even name. Like the colors at the foot of a sudden rainbow, the
                great columns of light stood side by side on the other side of Torak's fallen body. Then, indistinctly,
                Garion perceived that a glowing, incandescent figure stood within the center of each column of light.
                The Gods had returned to mourn the passing of their brother. Garion recognized Aldur, and he could
                easily identify each of the others. Mara still wept, and dead-eyed Issa seemed to undulate, serpentlike,
                as he stood within his glowing column of pale green light. Nedra's face was shrewd, and Chaldan's proud.
                Belar, the blondhaired, boyish God of the Alorns had a roguish, impudent look about him, though his
                face, like those of his brothers, was sad at the death of Torak. The Gods had returned to earth in
                glowing light and with sound as well. The reeking air of Cthol Mishrak was suddenly alive with that
                sound as each colored beam of light gave off a different note, the notes joining in a harmony so
                profound that it seemed the answer to every question that had ever been asked.
            </p>
            <p>And finally, joining the other columns of light, a single, blindingly white beam slowly descended, and
                within the center of that radiance stood the white-robed form of UL, that strange God whom Garion had
                seen once in Prolgu.
            </p>
            <p>The figure of Aldur, still embraced in its glowing blue nimbus, approached the ancient God of Ulgo.</p>
            <p>"Father," Aldur said sadly, "our brother, thy son Torak, is slain."</p>
            <p>Shimmering and incandescent, the form of UL, father of the other Gods, moved across the rubble-strewn
                ground to stand over the silent body of Torak.
            </p>
            <p>"I tried to turn thee from this path, my son," he said softly, and a single tear coursed its way down his
                eternal cheek. Then he turned back to Aldur. "Take up the form of thy bother, my son, and place it upon
                some more suitable resting place. It grieves me to see him lie so low upon the earth."
            </p>
            <p>Aldur, joined by his brethren, took up the body of Torak and placed it upon a large block of stone lying
                amid the ancient ruins, and then, standing in a quiet gleaming circle about the bier, they mourned the
                passing of the God of Angarak.
            </p>
            <p>Unafraid as always, seemingly not even aware that the glowing figures which had descended from the sky
                were not human, Errand walked quite confidently to the shining form of UL. He reached out his small hand
                and tugged insistently at the God's robe.
            </p>
            <p>"Father," he said.</p>
            <p>UL looked down at the small face.</p>
            <p>"Father," Errand repeated, perhaps echoing Aldur, who had, in his use of that name, revealed at last the
                true identity of the God of Ulgo. "Father," the little boy said again. Then he turned and pointed at the
                silent form of Durnik. "Errand!" It was in some strange way more a command than a request.
            </p>
            <p>The face of UL became troubled. "It is not possible, child," he replied.</p>
            <p>"Father," the little boy insisted, "Errand."</p>
            <p>UL looked inquiringly at Garion, his eyes profoundly unsettled. "The child's request is serious," he said
                gravely, speaking not to Garion but to that other awareness, "and it places an obligation upon me - but
                it crosses the uncrossable boundary."
            </p>
            <p>"The boundary must remain intact," the dry voice replied through Garion's lips. "Thy sons are passionate,
                Holy UL, and having once crossed this line, they may be tempted to do so again, and perhaps in one such
                crossing they may change that which must not be changed. Let us not provide the instrumentality whereby
                Destiny must once more follow two divergent paths."
            </p>
            <p>UL sighed.</p>
            <p>"Wilt thou and thy sons, however, lend of your power to my instrument so that he may cross the
                boundary?"
            </p>
            <p>UL looked startled at that.</p>
            <p>"Thus will the boundary be protected, and thy obligation shall be met. It can happen in no other way."
            </p>
            <p>"Let it be as thou wilt," UL agreed. He turned then and a peculiar look passed between the father of the
                Gods and his eldest son, Aldur. Aldur, still bathed in blue light, turned from his sad contemplation of
                his dead brother toward Aunt Pol, who was still bowed over Durnik's body.
            </p>
            <p>"Be comforted, my daughter," he told her. "His sacrifice was for thee and for all mankind."</p>
            <p>"That is slight comfort, Master," she replied, her eyes full of tears. "This was the best of men."</p>
            <p>"All men die, my daughter, the best as well as the worst. In thy life thou halt seen this many times."
            </p>
            <p>"Yes, Master, but this is different."</p>
            <p>"In what way, beloved Polgara?" Aldur seemed to be pressing her for some reason.</p>
            <p>Aunt Pol bit her lip. "Because I loved him, Master," she replied finally.</p>
            <p>The faintest touch of a smile appeared on Aldur's lips. "Is that so difficult to say, my daughter?"</p>
            <p>She could not answer, but bowed again over Durnik's lifeless form.</p>
            <p>"Wouldst thou have us restore this man to thee, my daughter?" Aldur asked then.</p>
            <p>Her face came up sharply. "That isn't possible, Master," she said. "Please don't toy with my grief like
                this."
            </p>
            <p>"Let us however, consider that it may be possible," he told her. "Wouldst thou have us restore him?"</p>
            <p>"With all my heart, Master."</p>
            <p>"To what end? What task hast thou for this man that demands his restoration?"</p>
            <p>She bit her lip again. "To be my husband, Master," she blurted finally with a trace of defiance in her
                voice.
            </p>
            <p>"And was that also so very difficult to say? Art thou sure, however, that this love of throe derives not
                from thy grief, and that once this good man is restored, thy mind might not turn away from him? He is,
                thou must admit, most ordinary."
            </p>
            <p>"Durnik has never been ordinary," she flared with sudden heat. "He is the best and bravest man in the
                world."
            </p>
            <p>"I meant him no disrespect, Polgara, but no power loth infuse him. The force of the Will and the Word is
                not in him."
            </p>
            <p>"Is that so important, Master?"</p>
            <p>"Marriage must be a joining of equals, my daughter. How could this good, brave man be husband to thee, so
                long as thy power remains?"
            </p>
            <p>She looked at him helplessly.</p>
            <p>"Couldst thou, Polgara, limit thyself? Wouldst thou become his equal? With power no more than his?"</p>
            <p>She stared at him, hesitated, then blurted the one word, "Yes."</p>
            <p>Garion was shocked - not so much by Aunt Pol's acceptance but rather by Aldur's request. Aunt Pol's power
                was central to her very being. To remove it from her would leave her with nothing. What would she be
                without it? How could she even live without it? It was a cruel price to demand, and Garion had believed
                that Aldur was a kindly God.
            </p>
            <p>"I will accept thy sacrifice, Polgara," Aldur was saying. "I will speak with my father and my brothers.
                For good and proper reasons, we have denied ourselves this power, and we must all agree to it before any
                of us might attempt this violation of the natural order of things." And he returned to the sorrowful
                gathering about Torak's bier.
            </p>
            <p>"How could he do that?" Garion, his arm still about Ce'Nedra, demanded of his grandfather.</p>
            <p>"Do what?"</p>
            <p>"Ask her to give up her power like that? It will destroy her."</p>
            <p>"She's much stronger than you think, Garion," Belgarath assured him, "and Aldur's reasoning is sound. No
                marriage could survive that kind of inequality."
            </p>
            <p>Among the glowing Gods, however, one angry voice was raised. "No!" It was Mara, the weeping God of the
                Marags, who were no more. "Why should one man be restored when all my slaughtered children still lie
                cold and dead? Did Aldur hear my pleas? Did he come to my aid when my children died? I will not
                consent."
            </p>
            <p>"I hadn't counted on that," Belgarath muttered. "I'd better take steps before this goes any further." He
                crossed the littered ground and bowed respectfully. "Forgive my intrusion," he said, "but would my
                Master's brother accept a woman of the Marags as a gift in exchange for his aid in restoring Durnik?"
            </p>
            <p>Mara's tears, which had been perpetual, suddenly stopped, and his face became incredulous. "A Marag
                woman?" he demanded sharply. "None such exist. I would have known in my heart if one of my children had
                survived in Maragor."
            </p>
            <p>"Of a certainty, Lord Mara," Belgarath agreed quickly. "But what of those few who were carried out of
                Maragor to dwell in perpetual slavery-"
            </p>
            <p>"Knowest thou of such a one, Belgarath?" Mara asked with a desperate eagerness.</p>
            <p>The old man nodded. "We discovered her in the slave pens beneath Rak Cthol, Lord Mara. Her name is Taiba.
                She is but one, but a race may be restored by such a one as she - particularly if she be watched over by
                a loving God."
            </p>
            <p>"Where is Taiba, my daughter?"</p>
            <p>"In the care of Relg, the Ulgo," Belgarath replied. "They seem quite attached to each other," he added
                blandly.
            </p>
            <p>Mara looked at him thoughtfully. "A race may not be restored by one," he said, "even in the care of the
                most loving God. It requires two." He turned to UL. "Wilt thou give me this Ulgo, Father?" he asked. "He
                shall become the sire of my people."
            </p>
            <p>UL gave Belgarath a rather penetrating look. "Thou knowest that Relg hath another duty to perform," he
                said pointedly.
            </p>
            <p>Belgarath's expression was almost impish. "I'm certain that the Gorim and I can work out the details,
                Most Holy," he declared with utmost self confidence.
            </p>
            <p>"Aren't you forgetting something, Belgarath?" Silk asked diffidently, as if not wanting to intrude. "Relg
                has this little problem, remember?"
            </p>
            <p>Belgarath gave the little man a hard look.</p>
            <p>"I just thought I ought to mention it," Silk said innocently.</p>
            <p>Mara looked sharply at them. "What is this?"</p>
            <p>"A minor difficulty, Lord Mara," Belgarath said quickly. "One I'm certain Taiba can overcome. I have the
                utmost confidence in her in that particular area."
            </p>
            <p>"I will have the truth of this," Mara said firmly.</p>
            <p>Belgarath sighed and gave Silk another grim look. "Relg is a zealot, Lord Mara," he explained. "For
                religious reasons, he avoids certain -ah - forms of human contact."
            </p>
            <p>"Fatherhood is his destiny," UL said. "From him will issue a special child. I will explain this to him.
                He is an obedient man, and he will put aside his aversions for my sake."
            </p>
            <p>"Then thou wilt give him to me, Father?" Mara asked eagerly.</p>
            <p>"He is throe - with but one restriction - of which we will speak later."</p>
            <p>"Let us see this brave Sendar, then," Mara said, and all traces of his weeping were now gone.</p>
            <p>"Belgarion, " the voice in Garion's mind said.</p>
            <p>"What?"</p>
            <p>"The restoration of your friend is in your hands now."</p>
            <p>"Me? Why me?"</p>
            <p>"Must you always say that? Do you want Durnik's life restored?"</p>
            <p>"Of course, but I can't do it. I wouldn't even know where to begin."</p>
            <p>"You did it before. Remember the colt in the cave of the Gods?"</p>
            <p>Garion had almost forgotten that.</p>
            <p>"You are my instrument, Belgarion. I can keep you from making mistakes - most of the time anyway. Just
                relax; I'll show you what to do." Garion was already moving without conscious volition. He let his arm
                fall from about Ce'Nedra's shoulders, and, his sword still in his hand, he walked slowly toward Aunt Pol
                and Durnik's body. He looked once into her eyes as she sat with the dead man's head in her lap, and then
                he knelt beside the body.
            </p>
            <p>"For me, Garion," she murmured to him.</p>
            <p>"If I can, Aunt Pol," he said.</p>
            <p>Then, without knowing why, he laid the sword of the Rivan King upon the ground and took hold of the Orb
                at its pommel. With a faint click, the Orb came free in his hand. Errand, smiling now, approached from
                the other side and also knelt, taking up Durnik's lifeless hand in his. Holding the Orb in both hands,
                Garion reached out and put it against the dead man's chest. He was faintly conscious of the fact that
                the Gods had gathered about in a circle and that they had reached out their arms, palm to palm, forming
                an unbroken ring. Within that circle, a great light began to pulsate, and the Orb, as if in answer,
                glowed between his hands.
            </p>
            <p>The blank wall he had seen once before was there again, still black, impenetrable, and silent. As he had
                before in the cave of the Gods, Garion pushed tentatively against the substance of death itself,
                striving to reach through and pull his friend back into the world of the living.
            </p>
            <p>It was different this time. The colt he had brought to life in the cave had never lived except within its
                mother's body. Its death had been as tenuous as its life, and it lay but a short distance beyond the
                barrier.
            </p>
            <p>Durnik, however, had been a man full grown, and his death, like his life, was far more profound. With all
                his strength, Garion pushed. He could feel the enormous force of the combined wills of the Gods joining
                with his in the silent struggle, but the barrier would not yield.
            </p>
            <p>"Use the Orbl " the voice commanded.</p>
            <p>This time Garion focused all the power, his own and that of the Gods upon the round stone between his
                hands. It flickered, then glowed, then flickered again.
            </p>
            <p>"Help me!" Garion commanded it.</p>
            <p>As if suddenly understanding, the Orb flared into a coruscating eruption of colored light. The barrier
                was weakening.
            </p>
            <p>With an encouraging little smile, Errand reached out and laid one hand upon the blazing Orb.</p>
            <p>The barrier broke. Durnik's chest heaved, and he coughed once. With profoundly respectful expression upon
                their eternal faces, the Gods stepped back. Aunt Pol cried out in sudden relief and clasped her arms
                about Durnik, cradling him against her.
            </p>
            <p>"Errand," the child said to Garion with a peculiar note of satisfaction. Garion stumbled to his feet,
                exhausted by the struggle and nearly staggering as he moved away.
            </p>
            <p>"Are you all right?" Ce'Nedra demanded of him, even as she ducked her head beneath his arm and firmly
                pulled it about her tiny shoulders. He nodded, though his knees almost buckled.
            </p>
            <p>"Lean on me," she told him.</p>
            <p>He was about to protest, but she put her hand firmly to his lips. "Don't argue, Garion," she told him.
                "You know that I love you and that you're going to be leaning on me for the rest of your life anyway, so
                you might as well get used to the idea."
            </p>
            <p>"I think my life's going to be different now, Master," Belgarath was saying to Aldur. "Pol's always been
                there, ready to come when I called her - not always willingly, perhaps - but she always came. Now she'll
                have other concerns." He sighed. "I suppose our children all grow up and get married sometime."
            </p>
            <p>"This particular pose doth not become thee, my son," Aldur told him.</p>
            <p>Belgarath grinned. "I've never been able to slip anything past you, Master," he said. Then his face grew
                serious again. "Polgara's been almost like a son to me," he told Aldur, "but perhaps it's time that I
                let her be a woman. I've denied her that for too long."
            </p>
            <p>"As it seems best to thee, my son," Aldur said. "And now, I pray thee, go apart a little way and permit
                us our family grief." He looked at Torak's body lying on the bier and then at Garion. "I have but one
                more task for thee, Belgarion," he said. "Take the Orb and place it upon my brother's breast."
            </p>
            <p>"Yes, Master," Garion replied immediately. He removed his arm from about Ce'Nedra's shoulders and walked
                to the bier, trying not to look at the dead God's seared and twisted face. He reached out and laid the
                round blue stone upon the motionless chest of Kal Torak. Then he stepped back. Once again his little
                princess wormed her way beneath his arm and clasped him about the waist. It was not unpleasant, but he

            </p>
            <p>had the brief, irrational thought that things would be awkward if she were going to insist on this close
                embrace for the rest of their lives.
            </p>
            <p>Once again the Gods formed their circle, and once again the Orb began to glow. Gradually, the seared face
                started to change, its maiming slowly disappearing. The light surrounding the Gods and the bier grew
                stronger, and the glow of the Orb became incandescent. The last Garion saw of the face of Torak, it was
                calm, composed and unmarked. It was a beautiful face, but it was nonetheless still a dead face.
            </p>
            <p>And then the light grew so intense that Garion could no longer look at it. When it subsided, and when
                Garion looked back at the bier, the Gods and the body of Torak were gone. Only the Orb remained, glowing
                slightly as it lay on the rough stone.
            </p>
            <p>Errand, once again with that confident look, went to the bier. Standing on his tiptoes, he reached across
                the block to retrieve the glowing stone. Then he carried it to Garion. "Errand, Belgarion," he said
                firmly, handing the Orb back, and in their touch as the Orb exchanged hands, Garion felt something
                profoundly different.
            </p>
            <p>Drawn together by what had happened, the little group silently gathered about Aunt Pol and Durnik. To the
                east, the sky had begun to lighten, and the rosy blush of dawn touched the few last remaining tatters of
                the cloud that had covered Cthol Mishrak. The events of the dreadful night had been titanic, but now the
                night was nearly over, and they stood together, not speaking as they watched the dawn.
            </p>
            <p>The storm that had raged through the long night had passed. For years beyond counting, the universe had
                been divided against itself, but now it was one again. If there were such things as beginnings, this was
                a beginning. And so it was, through broken cloud, that the sun rose on the morning of the first day.

        <title><p>The Isle Of The Winds</p></title>
        <chapter number="25">
            <p>BELGARION OF RIVA slept very fitfully the night before his wedding. Had he and Ce'Nedra been married in
                some simple, private little ceremony shortly after his meeting with Torak, things might have gone more
                smoothly. At that time both he and his flighty little princess had been too tired and too overwhelmed by
                the events which had taken place to be anything but absolutely honest with each other.
            </p>
            <p>During those few short days he had found her to be almost a different person. She had watched his every
                move with a kind of patient adoration, and she was forever touching him - his hair, his face, his arms -
                her fingers gentle and curious. The peculiar way she had of coming up to him, no matter who was present
                or what was going on, and worming her way into the circle of his arm had been, on the whole, rather
                nice.
            </p>
            <p>Those days had not, however, lasted. Once she had reassured herself that he was all right and that he was
                really there and not some figment of her imagination which might be snatched away at any moment,
                Ce'Nedra had gradually changed. He felt somehow like a possession; following her initial delight in
                ownership, his princess had rather deliberately embarked upon some grand plan of alteration.
            </p>
            <p>And now the day upon which her possession of him was to be formalized was only hours away. His sleep came
                in fits and starts with dreams mingling peculiarly with memories as he dipped in and out of sleep like a
                sea bird skimming across the waves.
            </p>
            <p>He was at Faldor's farm again. Even in his sleep he could hear the ringing of Durnik's hammer and smell
                the odors coming from Aunt Pol's kitchen. Rundorig was there - and Zubrette - and Doroon - and there was
                Brill, creeping around a corner. He half woke and turned restlessly in the royal bed. That wasn't
                possible.
            </p>
            <p>Doroon was dead, drowned in the River Mardu, and Brill had vanished forever over the parapet of mile-high
                Rak Cthol.
            </p>
            <p>And then he was in the palace at Sthiss Tor, and Salmissra, her blatant nudity glowing through her filmy
                gown, was touching his face with her cold fingers.
            </p>
            <p>But Salmissra was no longer a woman. He had watched her himself as she had changed into a serpent.</p>
            <p>Grul the Eldrak hammered at the frozen ground with his iron-shod club, bellowing, "Come 'Grat, fight!"
            </p>
            <p>and Ce'Nedra was screaming. In the chaotic world of dreams half mixed with memories he saw Ctuchik, his
                face contorted with horror, exploding once more into nothingness in the hanging turret at Rak Cthol.
            </p>
            <p>And then he stood once again in the decaying ruin of Cthol Mishrak, his sword ablaze, and watched as
                Torak raised his arms to the rolling cloud, weeping tears of fire, and once again he heard the stricken
                God's final cry, "Mother!"
            </p>
            <p>He stirred, half rousing and shuddering as he always did when that dream recurred, but dipped almost
                immediately into sleep again.
            </p>
            <p>He was standing on the deck of Barak's ship just off the Mallorean coast, listening as King Anheg
                explained why Barak was chained to the mast.
            </p>
            <p>"We had to do it, Belgarath," the coarse-faced monarch said mournfully. "Right during the middle of that
                storm, he turned into a bear! He drove the crew to row toward Mallorea all night long, and then, just
                before daybreak, he turned back into a man again."
            </p>
            <p>"Unchain him, Anheg," Belgarath said disgustedly. "He's not going to turn into a bear again - not as long
                as Garion's safe and well." Garion rolled over and sat up. That had been a startling revelation.
            </p>
            <p>There had been a purpose behind Barak's periodic alterations.</p>
            <p>"You're Garion's defender," Belgarath had explained to the big man. "That's why you were born. Any time
                Garion was in mortal danger, you changed into a bear in order to protect him."
            </p>
            <p>"You mean to say that I'm a sorcerer?" Barak had demanded incredulously.</p>
            <p>"Hardly. The shape-change isn't all that difficult, and you didn't do it consciously. The Prophecy did
                the work, not you."
            </p>
            <p>Barak had spent the rest of the voyage back to Mishrak ac Thull trying to come up with a tastefully
                understated way to add that concept to his coat of arms.
            </p>
            <p>Garion climbed out of his high, canopied bed and went to the window. The stars in the spring sky looked
                down at the sleeping city of Rivan and at the dark waters of the Sea of the Winds beyond the harbor.
                There was no sign that dawn was anywhere near yet. Garion sighed, poured himself a drink of water from
                the pitcher on the table, and went back to bed and his troubled sleep.
            </p>
            <p>He was at Thull Zelik, and Hettar and Mandorallen were reporting on the activities of 'Zakath, the
                Mallorean Emperor. "He's laying siege to Rak Goska right now," hawkfaced Hettar was saying. There had
                been a peculiar softening in Hettar's face since Garion had last seen him, as if something very
                significant had happened. The tall Algar turned to Garion. "Eventually you're going to have to do
                something about 'Zakath," he said. "I don't think you want him roaming around at will in this part of
                the world."
            </p>
            <p>"Why me?" Garion asked without thinking.</p>
            <p>"You're Overlord of the West, remember?"</p>
            <p>Once again Garion awoke. Sooner or later he would have to deal with 'Zakath; there was no question about
                that. Maybe after the wedding, he'd have time to consider the matter. That thought, however, stopped
                him.
            </p>
            <p>Strangely, he had no conception of anything that might happen after the wedding. It stood before him
                like
            </p>
            <p>some huge door that led into a place he had never been. 'Zakath would have to wait. Garion had to get
                through the wedding first.
            </p>
            <p>Half asleep, somewhere between dreaming and remembering, Garion relived a significant little exchange
                between himself and her Imperial Highness.
            </p>
            <p>"It's stupid, Ce'Nedra," he was protesting. "I'm not going to fight anybody, so why should I ride in
                waving my sword?"
            </p>
            <p>"They deserve to see you, Garion," she explained as if talking to a child. "They left their homes and
                rode into battle at your summons."
            </p>
            <p>"I didn't summon anybody."</p>
            <p>"I did it in your behalf. They're a very good army, really, and I raised them all by myself. Aren't you
                proud of me?"
            </p>
            <p>"I didn't ask you to do that."</p>
            <p>"You were too proud to ask. That's one of your failings, Garion. You must never be too proud to ask the
                people who love you for help. Every man in the army loves you. They followed me because of you. Is it
                too much trouble for the great Overlord of the West to reward his faithful soldiers with just a little
                bit of a display or appreciation? Or have you become too grand and lofty for simple gratitude?"
            </p>
            <p>"You're twisting things, Ce'Nedra. You do that a lot, you know." But Ce'Nedra had already moved on as if
                the entire matter were settled. "And of course you will wear your crown - and some nice armor. I think a
                mail shirt would be appropriate."
            </p>
            <p>"I'm not going to make a clown of myself just to satisfy your urges toward cheap theatricality."</p>
            <p>Her eyes filled. Her lower lip trembled. "You don't love me any more," she accused him in a quavering
                little voice.
            </p>
            <p>Garion groaned even in his sleep. It always came down to that. She won every single argument with that
                artful bit of deception. He knew it was not genuine. He knew that she only did it to get her own way,
                but he was absolutely defenseless against it. It might have nothing whatsoever to do with the matter
                under discussion, but she always managed to twist things around until she could unleash that devastating
                accusation, and all hope of his winning even the smallest point was immediately lost. Where had she
                learned to be so heartlessly dishonest?
            </p>
            <p>And so it was that Garion, dressed in mail, wearing his crown and self consciously holding his flaming
                sword aloft, had ridden into the forts atop the eastern escarpment to the thunderous cheers of
                Ce'Nedra's army.
            </p>
            <p>So much had happened since Garion and Silk and Belgarath had crept from the citadel at Riva the previous
                spring. The young king lay musing in his high, canopied bed, having almost given up on sleep. Ce'Nedra
                had in fact raised an army. As he had heard more of the details, he had been more and more astonished -
            </p>
            <p>not only by her audacity but also by the enormous amount of energy and sheer will she had expended in the
                process. She had been guided and assisted, certainly, but the initial concept had been hers. His
                admiration for her was tinged slightly with apprehension. He was going to marry a very strongminded
                young woman -
            </p>
            <p>and one who was not overly troubled by scruples.</p>
            <p>He rolled over and punched at his pillow, hoping somehow by that familiar act to bring on more normal
                sleep, but once again he slipped into restless dreaming. Relg and Taiba were walking toward him, and
                they were holding hands!
            </p>
            <p>And then he was at the Stronghold, sitting at Adara's bedside. His beautiful cousin was even paler than
                he remembered, and she had a persistent, racking cough. Even as the two of them talked, Aunt Pol was
                taking steps to remedy the last complications of the wound which had so nearly claimed the girl's life.
            </p>
            <p>"I was mortified, of course," Adara was saying. "I'd taken so much care to conceal it from him, and now
                I'd gone and blurted it out to him, and I wasn't even dying."
            </p>
            <p>"Hettar?" Garion said again. He'd already said it three times.</p>
            <p>"If you don't stop that, Garion, I'm going to be cross with you," Adara said quite firmly.</p>
            <p>"I'm sorry," he apologized quickly. "It's just that I've never considered him in that light. He's a good
                friend, but I never thought of him as particularly loveable. He's so - I don't know - implacable, I
                suppose."
            </p>
            <p>"I have certain reasons to believe that may change," Adara said with a faint blush. Then she began to
                cough again.
            </p>
            <p>"Drink this, dear," Aunt Pol ordered, coming to the bedside with a fuming cup.</p>
            <p>"It's going to taste awful," Garion warned his cousin.</p>
            <p>"That will do, Garion," Aunt Pol told him. "I can manage this without the helpful comments."</p>
            <p>And then he was in the caves beneath Prolgu, standing beside Relg as the Gorim performed the simple
                ceremony uniting the zealot and the Marag woman who had so totally changed Relg's life. Garion sensed
                another presence in the underground chamber, and he wondered if anyone had yet told Relg about the
                bargain that had been struck in Cthol Mishrak. He'd thought about saying something himself, but had
                decided against it. All things considered, it might be best to let Relg adjust to one thing at a time.
                Marriage to Taiba was probably going to be enough of a shock to the fanatic's system for now. Garion
                could feel Mara's gloating exultation as the ceremony concluded. The weeping God no longer wept.
            </p>
            <p>It was useless, Garion decided. He was not going to be able to sleep - at least not the kind of sleep
                that would do him any good. He threw off the covers and pulled on his robe. The fire in his fireplace
                had been banked for the night, and he stirred it up again. Then he sat in the chair in front of it,
                staring pensively into the dancing flames.
            </p>
            <p>Even if his wedding to Ce'Nedra had taken place immediately upon their arrival back at Riva, things might
                still have turned out all right, but the arrangements for a royal wedding of this magnitude were far too
                complex to be made overnight, and many of those who were to be honored guests were still recuperating
                from wounds received during the battle of Thull Mardu.
            </p>
            <p>The interim had given Ce'Nedra time to embark upon a full-blown plan of modification. She had, it
                appeared, a certain concept of him - some ideal which only she could perceive - and she was absolutely
                determined to cram him into that mold despite all his objections and protests. Nothing could make her
                relent in her singleminded drive to make him over. It was so unfair. He was quite content to accept her
                exactly as she was. She had her flaws - many of them - but he was willing to take the good with the bad.
            </p>
            <p>Why couldn't she extend him the same courtesy? But each time he tried to put his foot down and absolutely
                refuse one of her whims, her eyes would fill with tears, her lip would tremble, and the fatal, "You
                don't love me any more," would drop quaveringly upon him.
            </p>
            <p>Belgarion of Riva had considered flight several times during that long winter.</p>
            <p>Now it was spring again, and the storms which isolated the Isle of the Winds during the winter months
                were past. The day which Garion felt would never come had suddenly rushed upon him. Today was the day in
                which he would take the Imperial Princess Ce'Nedra to wife, and it was too late to run.
            </p>
            <p>He knew that if he brooded about it much longer, he'd push himself over the edge into total panic, and so
                he stood up and quickly dressed himself in plain tunic and hose, ignoring the more ostentatious garments
                which his valet - at Ce'Nedra's explicit instructions - had laid out for him.
            </p>
            <p>It was about an hour before daylight as the young king of Riva opened the door to the royal apartment and
                slipped into the silent corridor outside.
            </p>
            <p>He wandered for a time through the dim, empty halls of the Citadel, and then, inevitably, his undirected
                steps led him to Aunt Pol's door. She was already awake and seated by her fire with a cup of fragrant
                tea in her hands. She wore a deep blue dressing gown, and her dark hair flowed down across her shoulders
                in a lustrous wave.
            </p>
            <p>"You're up early," she noted.</p>
            <p>"I couldn't sleep."</p>
            <p>"You should have. You have a very full day ahead of you."</p>
            <p>"I know. That's why I couldn't sleep."</p>
            <p>"Tea?"</p>
            <p>"No, thanks." He sat in the carved chair on the other side of the fireplace. "Everything's changing, Aunt
                Pol," he said after a moment of thoughtful silence. "After today, nothing will ever be the same again,
                will it?"
            </p>
            <p>"Probably not," she said, "but that doesn't necessarily mean that it will be a change for the worse."</p>
            <p>"How do you feel about the idea of getting married?"</p>
            <p>"A bit nervous," she admitted calmly.</p>
            <p>"You?"</p>
            <p>"I've never been married before either, Garion."</p>
            <p>Something had been bothering him about that. "Was it really such a good idea, Aunt Pol?" he asked her. "I
                mean, arranging to have you and Durnik get married on the same day as Ce'Nedra and I? What I'm trying to
                say is that you're the most important woman in the world. Shouldn't your wedding be a special occasion?"
            </p>
            <p>"That was what we were trying to avoid, Garion," she replied. "Durnik and I decided that we wanted our
                wedding to be private, and we hope that it will be lost in all the confusion and ceremony that's going
                to surround yours."
            </p>
            <p>"How is he? I haven't seen him for several days now."</p>
            <p>"He's still a bit strange. I don't think he'll ever be the same man we all knew."</p>
            <p>"He's all right, isn't he?" Garion's guestion was concerned.</p>
            <p>"He's fine, Garion. He's just a bit different, that's all. Something happened to him that's never
                happened to any other man, and it changed him. He's as practical as ever, but now he looks at the other
                side of things as well. I think I rather like that."
            </p>
            <p>"Do you really have to leave Riva?" he asked suddenly. "You and Durnik could stay here in the Citadel."
            </p>
            <p>"We want our own place, Garion," she told him. "We need to be alone with each other. Besides, if I were
                here, every time you and Ce'Nedra had a squabble, I'd have one or both of you hammering on my door. I've
                done my best to raise you two. Now you're going to have to work things out on your own."
            </p>
            <p>"Where will you go?"</p>
            <p>"To the Vale. My mother's cottage is still standing there. It's a very solid house. All it needs is new
                thatching on the roof and new doors and windows. Durnik will know how to take care of that, and it will
                be a good place for Errand to grow up."
            </p>
            <p>"Errand? You're taking him with you?"</p>
            <p>"Someone has to care for him, and I've grown used to having a small boy around. Besides, father and I've
                decided that we'd like for him to be some distance from the Orb. He's still the only one besides you who
                can touch it. Someone at some time might seize upon that and try to use him in the same way Zedar did."
            </p>
            <p>"What'd be the point? I mean, Torak's gone now. What good would the Orb do anybody else?" .</p>
            <p>She looked at him very gravely, and the white lock of her brow seemed to glow in the soft light. "I don't
                believe that was the only reason for the Orb's existence, Garion," she told him seriously. "Something
                hasn't been completed yet."
            </p>
            <p>"What? What else is there left to do?"</p>
            <p>"We don't know. The Mrin Codex does not end with the meeting between the Child of Light and the Child of
                Dark. You're the Guardian of the Orb now, and it's still as important as ever, so don't just put it on
                the back shelf of a closet somewhere and forget about it. Be watchful, and don't let ordinary affairs
                dull your mind. Keeping the Orb is still your first duty - and I'm not going to be here to remind you
                about it every day."
            </p>
            <p>He didn't want to think about that. "What will you do if somebody comes to the Vale and tries to take
                Errand away? You won't be able to protect him, now that-" He faltered to a stop. He had not spoken to
                her about that.
            </p>
            <p>"Go ahead and say it, Garion," she said directly. "Let's look it right in the face. You were going to say
                now that I no longer have any power."
            </p>
            <p>"What's it like, Aunt Pol? Is it like losing something - a sort of emptiness, maybe?"</p>
            <p>"I feel the same as always, dear. Of course I haven't tried to do anything since I agreed to give it up.
                It might be painful if I tried to make something happen and failed. I don't think I'd care for the
                experience, so I simply haven't tried." She shrugged. "That part of my life is over, so I'll just have
                to put it behind me.
            </p>
            <p>Errand will be safe, though. Beldin's in the Vale - and the twins. That's enough power in one place to
                keep away anything that might want to harm him."
            </p>
            <p>"Why's Durnik spending so much time with Grandfather?" Garion asked suddenly. "Ever since we got back to
                Riva, they've been together just about every minute they were awake."
            </p>
            <p>She gave him a knowing smile. "I imagine they're preparing some surprise for me," she replied. "Some
                suitable wedding present. They both tend to be a trifle transparent."
            </p>
            <p>"What is it?" Garion asked curiously.</p>
            <p>"I haven't the slightest idea - and I wouldn't dream of trying to find out. Whatever it is, they've both
                worked too hard at it for me to spoil it for them by snooping around." She glanced at the window where
                the first light of dawn was appearing. "Perhaps you'd better run along now, dear," she suggested. "I
                have to start getting ready. This is a very special day for me, too, and I really want to look my best."
            </p>
            <p>"You could never look anything less than beautiful, Aunt Pol," he told her sincerely.</p>
            <p>"Why thank you, Garion." She smiled at him, looking somehow almost girlish. "But I'd rather not take the
                chance." She gave him an appraising glance and touched his cheek. "Why don't you visit the baths, dear,"
            </p>
            <p>she suggested, "and wash your hair and get somebody to shave you."</p>
            <p>"I can do that myself, Aunt Pol."</p>
            <p>"That's not a good idea, Garion. You're a little nervous today, and you don't want to put a razor to your
                face when your hands are trembling."
            </p>
            <p>He laughed a bit ruefully, kissed her, and started toward the door. Then he stopped and turned back
                toward her. "I love you, Aunt Pol," he said simply.
            </p>
            <p>"Yes, dear, I know. I love you, too."</p>
            <p>After he had visited the baths, Garion went looking for Lelldorin. Among the matters that had finally
                been settled was the marital status of the young Asturian and his semiofficial bride. Ariana had finally
                despaired of Lelldorin's ever making the first move on his own and had solved the entire problem by
                simply moving in with him. She had been quite firm about it. Garion gathered that Lelldorin's resistance
                had faded rather quickly. His expression of late had been somewhat more foolish than usual, and Ariana's
                had been, although radiant, just a trifle smug. In a peculiar way, they closely resembled Relg and Taiba
                in that respect. Since his wedding, Relg's expression had been one of almost perpetual astonishment,
                while Taiba's had that same smugness that marked Ariana's. Garion wondered if he might not awaken
                tomorrow morning to see that same self satisfied little smirk on Ce'Nedra's lips.
            </p>
            <p>There was a purpose to Garion's search for his Asturian friend. As a result of one of Ce'Nedra's whims,
                their wedding was going to be followed by a grand ball, and Lelldorin had been teaching Garion how to
                dance.
            </p>
            <p>The idea of the ball had been greeted with enthusiasm by all the ladies; the men, however, had not been
                universal in their approval. Barak had been particularly vehement in his objections.
            </p>
            <p>"You want me to get in the middle of the floor and dance?" he had demanded of the princess in an outraged
                tone of voice. "What's wrong with all of us just getting drunk? That's the normal way to celebrate a
                wedding."
            </p>
            <p>"You'll be just fine," Ce'Nedra had told him, patting his cheek in that infuriating way of hers. "And you
                will do it, won't you, Barak - for me?" And she had insincerely fluttered her eyelashes at him.
            </p>
            <p>Barak had stamped away, muttering curses under his breath.</p>
            <p>Garion found Lelldorin and Ariana doting on each other across the breakfast table in their rooms.</p>
            <p>"Wilt thou take breakfast with us, your Majesty?" Ariana inquired politely.</p>
            <p>"Thanks all the same, my Lady," Garion declined, "but I don't seem to have much appetite today."</p>
            <p>"Nerves," Lelldorin observed sagely.</p>
            <p>"I think I've got most of it," Garion rushed to the core of his problem, "but that crossover baffles me.
                My feet keep getting all tangled up."
            </p>
            <p>Lelldorin immediately fetched a lute, and with Ariana's help, walked Garion through the complex
                procedure.
            </p>
            <p>"Thou art becoming most skilled, your Majesty," Ariana complimented him at the end of the lesson.</p>
            <p>"All I want to do is get through it without tripping and falling on my face in public."</p>
            <p>"The princess would surely support thee, shouldst thou stumble."</p>
            <p>"I'm not sure about that. She might enjoy watching me make a fool of myself."</p>
            <p>"How little thou knowest of women." Ariana gave Lelldorin an adoring look - a look he fatuously
                returned.
            </p>
            <p>"Will you two stop that?" Garion demanded irritably. "Can't you wait until you're alone to carry on that
                way?"
            </p>
            <p>"My heart is too full of love for me to hide it, Garion," Lelldorin said extravagantly.</p>
            <p>"So I've noticed," Garion said dryly. "I've got to go see Silk, so I'll leave you two to your
                amusements."
            </p>
            <p>Ariana blushed, then smiled. "Might we take that as a royal command, your Majesty?" she asked archly.</p>
            <p>Garion fled.</p>
            <p>Silk had arrived from the east late the previous evening, and Garion was anxious for news. He found the
                little Drasnian lingering over a breakfast of partridge and hot, spiced wine.
            </p>
            <p>"Isn't that a little heavy for breakfast?" Garion asked him.</p>
            <p>"I've never been that partial to gruel first thing in the morning," Silk replied. "Gruel's the sort of
                thing a man has to work himself up to."
            </p>
            <p>Garion went directly to the point. "What's happening in Cthol Murgos?"</p>
            <p>"'Zakath is still laying siege to Rak Goska," Silk reported. "He's transporting in more troops, though.
                It's pretty obvious that he's going to strike into southern Cthol Murgos as soon as the ground's firm
                enough to move an army."
            </p>
            <p>"Are the Thulls with him?"</p>
            <p>"Only a few. Most of them are concentrating on finding the few Grolims left in their kingdom. I always
                thought Thulls were a stupid people, but you'd be amazed at how creative they can be when it comes to
                finding new and interesting ways for Grolims to die."
            </p>
            <p>"We're going to have to keep an eye on 'Zakath," Garion said. "I wouldn't want him to come creeping up on
                me from the south."
            </p>
            <p>"I think you can count on him not to creep," Silk said. "He sent you a message of congratulations,
                incidentally."
            </p>
            <p>"He did what?"</p>
            <p>"He's a civilized man, Garion - and a politician. He was badly shaken by the fact that you killed Torak.
                I think he's actually afraid of you, so he wants to stay on your good side - at least until he finishes
                up in southern Cthol Murgos."
            </p>
            <p>"Who's in command of the Murgos, now that Taur Urgas is dead?"</p>
            <p>"Urgit, his third son by his second wife. There was the usual squabble over the succession by the various
                sons of Taur Urgas's assorted wives. The fatalities were numerous, I understand."
            </p>
            <p>"What kind of man is Urgit?"</p>
            <p>"He's a schemer. I don't think he's any match for 'Zakath, but he'll keep the Malloreans busy for ten or
                twenty years. By then, 'Zakath may be too old and tired of war to give you any problems."
            </p>
            <p>"Let's hope so."</p>
            <p>"Oh, I almost forgot. Hettar married your cousin last week."</p>
            <p>"Adara? I thought she was ill."</p>
            <p>"Not that much, apparently. They're coming to your wedding along with Cho-Hag and Silar."</p>
            <p>"Is everybody getting married?"</p>
            <p>Silk laughed. "Not me, my young friend. In spite of this universal plunge toward matrimony, I still
                haven't lost my senses. If worse comes to worst, I still know how to run. The Algars should arrive
                sometime this morning. They met Korodullin's entourage, and they're all coming together. Their ship was
                right behind mine when we left Camaar."
            </p>
            <p>"Was Mandorallen with them?"</p>
            <p>Silk nodded. "Along with the Baroness of Vo Ebor. The Baron's still much too ill to travel. I think he's
                hoping that he'll die, to leave the way clear for his wife and Mandorallen."
            </p>
            <p>Garion sighed.</p>
            <p>"Don't let it make you unhappy, Garion," Silk advised. "Arends actually enjoy that kind of misery.</p>
            <p>Mandorallen's perfectly content to suffer nobly."</p>
            <p>"That's a rotten thing to say," Garion accused the little man.</p>
            <p>Silk shrugged. "I'm a rotten sort of person," he admitted.</p>
            <p>"Where are you going after-" Garion left it hanging.</p>
            <p>"After I see you safely married?" Silk suggested pleasantly. "As soon as I recover from all the drinking
                I'll do tonight, I'll be off for Gar og Nadrak. There's a great deal of opportunity in the new situation
                there. I've been in contact with Yarblek. He and I are going to form a partnership."
            </p>
            <p>"With Yarblek?"</p>
            <p>"He's not so bad - if you keep an eye on him - and he's very shrewd. We'll probably do rather well
                together."
            </p>
            <p>"I can imagine." Garion laughed. "One of you is bad enough all by himself, but with the two of you acting
                together, no honest merchant's going to escape with his skin."
            </p>
            <p>Silk grinned wickedly. "That was sort of what we had in mind."</p>
            <p>"I imagine that you'll get very rich."</p>
            <p>"I suppose I could learn to live with that." Silk's eyes took on a distant look. "That's not really what
                it's all about, though," he noted. "It's a game. The money's just a way of keeping score. It's the game
                that's important."
            </p>
            <p>"It seems to me that you told me that once before."</p>
            <p>"Nothing's changed since then, Garion," Silk told him with a laugh.</p>
            <p>Aunt Pol's wedding to Durnik took place later that morning in a small, private chapel in the west wing of
                the Citadel. There were but few guests. Belgarath and the twins, Beltira and Belkira, were there of
                course, and Silk and Barak. Aunt Pol, beautiful in a deep blue velvet gown, was attended by Queen Layla,
                and Garion stood with Durnik. The ceremony was performed by the hunchbacked Beldin, dressed for once in
                decent clothing and with a strangely gentle expression on his ugly face.
            </p>
            <p>Garion's emotions were very complex during the ceremony. He realized with a sharp little pang that Aunt
                Pol would no longer be exclusively his. An elemental, childish part of him resented that. He was,
                however, pleased that it was Durnik whom she was marrying. If anyone deserved her, it was Durnik. The
                good, plain man's eyes were filled with absolute love, and he obviously could not take them from her
                face. Aunt Pol herself was gravely radiant as she stood at Durnik's side.
            </p>
            <p>As Garion stepped back while the two exchanged vows, he heard a faint rustle. Just inside the door of the
                chapel, in a hooded cloak that covered her from head to foot and wearing a heavy veil that covered her
                face, stood Princess Ce'Nedra. She had made a large issue of the fact that by an ancient Tolnedran
                custom, Garion was not supposed to see her before their wedding on this day, and the cloak and veil
                provided her with the illusion of invisibility. He could imagine her wrestling with the problem until
                she had come up

            </p>
            <p>with this solution. Nothing could have kept her from Polgara's wedding, but all the niceties and
                formalities had to be observed. Garion smiled slightly as he turned back to the ceremony.
            </p>
            <p>It was the expression on Beldin's face that made him turn again to look sharply toward the back of the
                chapel - an expression of surprise that turned to calm recognition. At first Garion saw nothing, but
                then a faint movement up among the rafters caught his eye. The pale, ghostly shape of a snowy owl
                perched on one of the dark beams, watching as Aunt Pol and Durnik were married.
            </p>
            <p>When the ceremony was concluded and after Durnik had respectfully and rather nervously kissed his bride,
                the white owl spread her pinions to circle the chapel in ghostly silence. She hovered briefly as if in
                silent benediction over the happy couple; then with two soft beats of her wings, she moved through the
                breathless air to Belgarath. The old sorcerer resolutely averted his eyes.
            </p>
            <p>"You may as well look at her, father," Aunt Pol told him. "She won't leave until you recognize her."</p>
            <p>Belgarath sighed then, and looked directly at the oddly luminous bird hovering in the air before him. "I
                still miss you," he said very simply. "Even after all this time."
            </p>
            <p>The owl regarded him with her golden, unblinking eyes for a moment, then flickered and vanished.</p>
            <p>"What an absolutely astonishing thing," Queen Layla gasped.</p>
            <p>"We're astonishing people, Layla," Aunt Pol replied, "and we have a number of peculiar friends - and
                relatives." She smiled then, her arm closely linked in Durnik's. "Besides," she added with a twinkle in
                her eye, "you wouldn't really expect a girl to get married without her mother in attendance, would you?"
            </p>
            <p>Following the wedding, they all walked through the corridors of the Citadel back to the central fortress
                and stopped outside the door of Aunt Pol's private apartment. Garion was about to follow Silk and Barak
                as, after a few brief congratulations, they moved on down the hallway, but Belgarath put his hand on his
                grandson's arm. "Stay a moment," the old man said.
            </p>
            <p>"I don't think we should intrude, Grandfather," Garion said nervously.</p>
            <p>"We'll only stay for a few minutes," Belgarath assured him. The old man's lips were actually quivering
                with a suppressed mirth. "There's something I want you to see."
            </p>
            <p>One of Aunt Pol's eyebrows raised questioningly as her father and Garion followed into the apartment.</p>
            <p>"Are we responding to some ancient and obscure custom, father?" she asked.</p>
            <p>"No, Pol," he replied innocently. "Garion and I only want to toast your happiness, that's all."</p>
            <p>"What exactly are you up to, Old Wolf?" she asked him, but her eyes had an amused look in them.</p>
            <p>"Do I have to be up to something?"</p>
            <p>"You usually are, father."</p>
            <p>She did, however, fetch four crystal goblets and a decanter of fine old Tolnedran wine.</p>
            <p>"The four of us started all this together quite a long time ago," Belgarath recalled. "Perhaps, before we
                all separate, we should take a moment to remember that we've come a long way since then, and some rather
                strange things have happened to us. We've all changed in one way or another, I think."
            </p>
            <p>"You haven't changed all that much, father," Aunt Pol said meaningfully. "Would you get to the point?"
            </p>
            <p>Belgarath's eyes were twinkling openly now with some huge, suppressed mirth.</p>
            <p>"Durnik has something for you," he said.</p>
            <p>Durnik swallowed hard. "Now?" he asked Belgarath apprehensively. Belgarath nodded.</p>
            <p>"I know how much you love beautiful things - like that bird over there," Durnik said to Aunt Pol, looking
                at the crystal wren Garion had given her the previous year. "I wanted to give you something like that,
                too -
            </p>
            <p>only I can't work in glass or in gemstones. I'm a metalsmith, so I have to work in steel." He had been
                unwrapping something covered in plain cloth. What he produced finally was an intricately wrought steel
                rose, just beginning to open. The details were exquisite, and the flower glowed with a burnished life of
                its own.
            </p>
            <p>"Why, Durnik," Aunt Pol said, genuinely pleased. "How very lovely."</p>
            <p>Durnik, however, did not give her the rose yet. "It has no color, though," he noted a bit critically,
                "and no fragrance." He glanced nervously at Belgarath.
            </p>
            <p>"Do it," the old man told him. "The way I showed you."</p>
            <p>Durnik turned back to Aunt Pol, still holding the burnished rose in his hand. "I really have nothing to
                give you, my Pol," he told her humbly, "except an honest heart - and this." He held out the rose in his
                hand, and his face took on an expression of intense concentration.
            </p>
            <p>Garion heard it very clearly. It was a familiar, rushing surge of whispered sound, filled with a
                peculiarly bell-like shimmer. The polished rose in Durnik's outstretched hand seemed to pulsate
                slightly, and then gradually it began to change. The outsides of the petals were as white as new snow,
                but the insides, where the flower was just opening, were a deep, blushing red. When Durnik finished, he
                held a living flower out to Aunt Pol, its petals beaded with dew.
            </p>
            <p>Aunt Pol gasped as she stared incredulously at the rose. It was unlike any flower that had ever existed.
                With a trembling hand she took it from him, her eyes filled with sudden tears. "How is it possible?" she
                asked in an awed voice.
            </p>
            <p>"Durnik's a very special man now," Belgarath told her. "So far as I know, he's the only man who ever died
                and then lived again. That could not help changing him - at least a little. But then, I suspect that
                there's always been a poet lurking under the surface of our good, practical friend. Maybe the only real
                difference is that now he has a way of letting that poet out."
            </p>
            <p>Durnik, looking just a bit embarrassed, touched the rose with a tentative finger. "It does have one
                advantage, my Pol," he noted. "The steel is still in it, so it will never fade or wilt. It will stay
                just as it is now. Even in the middle of winter, you'll have at least one flower."
            </p>
            <p>"Oh, Durnik!" she cried, embracing him.</p>
            <p>Durnik looked a bit abashed as he awkwardly returned her embrace. "If you really like it, I could make
                you some others," he told her. "A whole garden of them, I suppose. It's not really all that hard, once
                you get the hang of it."
            </p>
            <p>Aunt Pol's eyes, however, had suddenly widened. With one arm still about Durnik, she turned slightly to
                look at the crystal wren perched upon its glass twig. "Fly," she said, and the glowing bird spread its
                wings and flew to her outstretched hand. Curiously it inspected the rose, dipped its beak into a dew
                drop, and then it lifted its head and began to sing a trilling little song. Gently Aunt Pol raised her
                hand aloft, and the crystal bird soared back to its glass twig. The echo of its song still hung in the
                silent air.
            </p>
            <p>"I expect it's time for Garion and me to be going," Belgarath said, his face rather sentimental and
                misty.
            </p>
            <p>Aunt Pol, however, had quite obviously realized something. Her eyes narrowed slightly, then went very
                wide. "Just a moment, Old Wolf," she said to Belgarath with a faint hint of steel in her voice. "You
                knew about this from the very beginning, didn't you?"
            </p>
            <p>"About what, Pol?" he asked innocently.</p>
            <p>"That Durnik - that I -" For the first time in his life Garion saw her at a loss for words. "You knew!"
                she flared.
            </p>
            <p>"Naturally. As soon as Durnik woke up, I could feel something different in him. I'm surprised you didn't
                feel it yourself. I had to work with him a bit to bring it out, though."
            </p>
            <p>"Why didn't you tell me?"</p>
            <p>"You didn't ask, Pol."</p>
            <p>"You - I -" With an enormous effort she gained control of herself. "All of these months you let me go on
                thinking that my power was gone, and it was there all the time! It was still there, and you put me
                through all of that?"
            </p>
            <p>"Oh, really, Pol. If you'd just stopped to think, you'd have realized that you can't give it up like
                that. Once it's there, it's there."
            </p>
            <p>"But our Master said-"</p>
            <p>Belgarath raised one hand. "If you'll just stop and remember, Pol, all he really asked was if you'd be
                willing to limit your independence in marriage and go through life with no more power than Durnik has.
                Since there's no way he could remove your power, he obviously had something else in mind."
            </p>
            <p>"You let me believe-"</p>
            <p>"I have no control over what you believe, Pol," he replied in his most reasonable tone of voice.</p>
            <p>"You tricked me!"</p>
            <p>"No, Pol," he corrected, "you tricked yourself." Then he smiled fondly at her. "Now, before you go off
                into a tirade, think about it for a moment. All things considered, it didn't really hurt you, did it?
                And isn't it really nicer to find out about it this way?" His smile became a grin. "You can even
                consider it my wedding present to you, if you'd like," he added.
            </p>
            <p>She stared at him for a moment, obviously wanting to be cross about the whole thing, but the look he
                returned her was impish. The confrontation between them had been obscure, but he had quite obviously won
                this time. Finally, no longer able to maintain even the fiction of anger, she laughed helplessly and put
                her hand affectionately on his arm. "You're a dreadful old man, father," she told him.
            </p>
            <p>"I know," he admitted. "Coming, Garion?"</p>
            <p>Once they were in the hall outside, Belgarath began to chuckle.</p>
            <p>"What's so funny?" Garion asked him.</p>
            <p>"I've been waiting for that moment for months," his grandfather said, still chortling. "Did you see her
                face when she finally realized what had happened? She's been moping around with that look of noble self
                sacrifice for all this time, and then she suddenly finds out that it was absolutely unnecessary." His
                face took on a wicked little smirk. "Your Aunt's always been just a little too sure of herself, you
                know. Maybe it was good for her to go for a little while thinking that she was just an ordinary person.
                It might give her some perspective."
            </p>
            <p>"She was right." Garion laughed. "You are a dreadful old man."</p>
            <p>Belgarath grinned. "One does one's best."</p>
            <p>They went along the hallway to the royal apartment where the clothes Garion was to wear for his wedding
                were already laid out. "Grandfather," Garion said, sitting down to pull off his boots, "there's
                something I've been meaning to ask you. Just before Torak died, he called out to his mother."
            </p>
            <p>Belgarath, tankard in hand, nodded.</p>
            <p>"Who is his mother?"</p>
            <p>"The universe," the old man replied.</p>
            <p>"I don't understand."</p>
            <p>Belgarath scratched thoughtfully at his short, white beard. "As I understand it, each of the Gods began
                as an idea in the mind of UL, the father of the Gods, but it was the universe that brought them forth.
                It's very complicated. I don't understand it entirely myself. Anyway, as he was dying, Torak cried out
                to the one thing that he felt still loved him. He was wrong, of course. UL and the other Gods did still
                love him, even though they knew that he had become twisted and totally evil. And the universe grieved
                for him."
            </p>
            <p>"The universe?"</p>
            <p>"Didn't you feel it? That instant when everything stopped and all the lights went out?"</p>
            <p>"I thought that was just me."</p>
            <p>"No, Garion. For that single instant all the light in the universe went out, and everything stopped
                moving -
            </p>
            <p>everything - everywhere. A part of that was the grief of the universe for her dead son."</p>
            <p>Garion thought about that. "He had to die, though, didn't he?"</p>
            <p>Belgarath nodded. "It was the only way that things could get back on the right course. Torak had to die
                so that things could go toward what they're supposed to. Otherwise, everything would have ultimately
                wound up in chaos."
            </p>
            <p>A sudden strange thought struck Garion.</p>
            <p>"Grandfather," he said, "who is Errand?"</p>
            <p>"I don't know," Belgarath replied. "Perhaps he's just a strange little boy. Perhaps he's something else.
                You'd probably better start changing clothes."
            </p>
            <p>"I was trying not to think about that."</p>
            <p>"Oh, come now. This is the happiest day of your life."</p>
            <p>"Really?"</p>
            <p>"It might help if you keep saying that to yourself."</p>
            <p>By general consent, the Gorim of Ulgo had been selected to perform the ceremony uniting Garion and
                Ce'Nedra in marriage. The frail, saintly old man had made the journey from Prolgu in short, easy stages,
                carried by litter through the caves to Sendaria, then conveyed in King Fulrach's royal carriage to the
                city of Sendar and thence by ship to Riva. The revelation of the fact that the God of the Ulgos was the
                father of the other Gods had struck theological circles like a thunderclap. Entire libraries of turgid
                philosophical speculation had instantly become obsolete, and priests everywhere now stumbled about in a
                state of shock.
            </p>
            <p>Grodeg, the High Priest of Belar, fainted dead away at the news. The towering ecclesiastic, already
                crippled for life by the wounds he had received during the battle of Thull Mardu, did not take this
                final blow well.
            </p>
            <p>When he recovered from his swoon, his attendants found that his mind had reverted to childhood, and he
                spent his days now surrounded by toys and brightly colored bits of string.
            </p>
            <p>The royal wedding, of course, took place in the Hall of the Rivan King, and everyone was there. King
                Rhodar was in crimson, King Anheg in blue. King Fulrach wore brown, and King Cho-Hag the customary Algar
                black. Brand, the Rivan Warder, his face made even more somber by the death of his youngest son, was
                dressed in Rivan gray. There were other royal visitors as well. Ran Borune XXIII in his goldcolored
                mantle was strangely jovial as he bantered with the shavenheaded Sadi. Oddly enough, the two of them got
                on well together. The possibilities of the new situation in the west appealed to them both, and they
                were obviously moving toward an accommodation of some sort. King Korodullin wore royal purple and stood
                about with the other kings - although he spoke but little. The blow to his head during the battle of
                Thull Mardu had affected his hearing, and the young king of Arendia was obviously uncomfortable in
                company.
            </p>
            <p>In the very center of the gathered monarchs stood King Drosta lek Thun of Gar og Nadrak, wearing a
                curiously unattractive yellow doublet. The nervous, emaciated king of the Nadrak's spoke in short little
                bursts, and when he laughed, there was a shrill quality in his voice. King Drosta made many arrangements
                that afternoon - some of which he even intended to honor.
            </p>
            <p>Belgarion of Riva, of course, did not participate in those discussions - which was probably just as well.
                The Rivan King's mind was a trifle distracted at that moment. Dressed all in blue, he paced nervously in
                a nearby antechamber where he and Lelldorin awaited the fanfare which was to summon them into the great
                hall.
            </p>
            <p>"I wish this was all over," he said for the sixth time.</p>
            <p>"Just be patient, Garion," Lelldorin advised him again.</p>
            <p>"What are they doing out there?"</p>
            <p>"Probably waiting for word that her Highness is ready. At this particular time, she's far more important
                than you are. That's the way weddings are, you know."
            </p>
            <p>"You're the lucky one. You and Ariana just ran off and got married without all this fuss."</p>
            <p>Lelldorin laughed ruefully. "I didn't really escape it, Garion," he said, "just postponed it for a while.
                All the preparations here have inflamed my Ariana. As soon as we return to Arendia, she wants us to have
                a proper wedding."
            </p>
            <p>"What is it about weddings that does such strange things to the female mind?"</p>
            <p>"Who can say?" Lelldorin shrugged. "A woman's mind is a mystery - as you'll soon discover."</p>
            <p>Garion gave him a sour look and adjusted his crown once again. "I wish it were all over," he said
                again.
            </p>
            <p>In time the fanfare echoed through the Hall of the Rivan King, the door opened, and, trembling visibly,
                Garion adjusted his crown one last time and marched out to meet his fate. Although he knew most of the
                people in the hall, the faces around him were all a blur as he and Lelldorin walked past the peat fires
                glowing in the pits in the floor toward the throne where his great sword once more hung in its proper
                place with the Orb of Aldur glowing on its pommel.
            </p>
            <p>The hall was hung with buntings and banners, and there was a vast profusion of spring flowers. The
                wedding guests, in silks, satins, and brightly colored brocades, seemed themselves almost like some
                flower garden as they twisted and strained to watch the entrance of the royal bridegroom.
            </p>
            <p>Awaiting him before the throne stood the white-robed old Gorim of Ulgo, a smile on his gentle face.</p>
            <p>"Greetings, Belgarion," the Gorim murmured as Garion mounted the steps.</p>
            <p>"Holy Gorim," Garion replied with a nervous bow.</p>
            <p>"Be tranquil, my son," the Gorim advised, noting Garion's shaking hands.</p>
            <p>"I'm trying, Holy One."</p>
            <p>The brazen horns sounded yet another fanfare, and the door at the back of the hall swung wide. The
                Imperial Princess Ce'Nedra, dressed in her creamy, pearl-studded wedding gown, stood in the doorway with
                her cousin Xera at her side. She was stunning. Her flaming hair streamed down across one shoulder of her
                gown, and she wore the varicolored golden circlet of which she had always been so fond. Her face was
                demure, and a delicate little blush colored her cheeks. She kept her eyes downcast, although once she
                flickered a quick glance at Garion, and he saw the little twinkle that lurked behind her thick lashes.
                He knew then with absolute certainty that all that demure modesty was a pose. She stood long enough to
                allow all to look their fill at her perfection before, accompanied by the sound of gently cascading
                harps, she came down the aisle to meet her quivering bridegroom. In a ceremony Garion thought just a
                trifle overdone, Barak's two little daughters preceded the bride, strewing her path with flowers.
            </p>
            <p>When she reached the dais, Ce'Nedra rather impulsively kissed the kindly old Gorim's cheek and then took
                her place at Garion's side. There was a fragrance about her that was strangely flowerlike - a fragrance
                that for some reason made Garion's knees tremble.
            </p>
            <p>The Gorim looked out at the assemblage and began to speak.</p>
            <p>"We are gathered today," he began, "to witness the last unraveling of the Prophecy which has guided all
                our lives through the deadliest of peril and brought us safely to this happy moment. As foretold, the
                Rivan King has returned. He has met our ancient foe and he has prevailed. His reward stands radiant at
                his side."
            </p>
            <p>Reward? Garion had not considered it in precisely that light before. He thought about it a bit as the
                Gorim continued, but it didn't really help all that much. He felt a sharp little nudge in his ribs.
            </p>
            <p>"Pay attention," Ce'Nedra whispered.</p>
            <p>It got down to the questions and answers shortly after that. Garion's voice cracked slightly, but that
                was only to be expected. Ce'Nedra's voice, however, was clear and firm. Couldn't she at least pretend to
                be nervous just a little?
            </p>
            <p>The rings which they exchanged were carried on a small velvet cushion by Errand. The child took his
                duties quite seriously, but even on his small face there was that slightly amused look. Garion resented
                that.
            </p>
            <p>Was everyone secretly laughing at him?</p>
            <p>The ceremony concluded with the Gorim's benediction, which Garion did not hear. The Orb of Aldur, glowing
                with an insufferable smugness, filled his ears with its song of jubilation during the Gorim's blessing,
                adding its own peculiar congratulations.
            </p>
            <p>Ce'Nedra had turned to him. "Well?" she whispered.</p>
            <p>"Well what?" he whispered back.</p>
            <p>"Aren't you going to kiss me?"</p>
            <p>"Here? In front of everybody?"</p>
            <p>"It's customary."</p>
            <p>"It's a stupid custom."</p>
            <p>"Just do it, Garion," she said with a warm little smile of encouragement. "We can discuss it later."</p>
            <p>Garion tried for a certain dignity in the kiss - a kind of chaste formality in keeping with the general
                tone of the occasion. Ce'Nedra, however, would have none of that. She threw herself into the business
                with an enthusiasm which Garion found slightly alarming. Her arms locked about his neck and her lips
                were glued to his. He irrationally wondered just how far she intended to go with this. His knees were
                already beginning to buckle.
            </p>
            <p>The cheer which resounded through the hall saved him. The trouble with kissing in public was that one was
                never sure just how long one should keep it up. If it were too short, people might suspect a lack of
                regard; if it were too long, they might begin to snicker. Grinning rather foolishly, Belgarion of Riva
                turned to face the wedding guests.
            </p>
            <p>The wedding ball and the supper which was part of it immediately followed the ceremony. Chatting gaily,
                the wedding guests trooped through a long corridor to a brightly decorated hall which had been converted
                into a grand ballroom ablaze with candles. The orchestra was composed of Rivan musicians under the

            </p>
            <p>direction of a fussy Arendish concertmaster, who strove mightily to keep the independent Rivans from
                improvising on those melodies which pleased them.
            </p>
            <p>This was the part Garion had dreaded the most. The first dance was to be a solo affair featuring the
                royal couple. He was expected to march Ce'Nedra to the center of the floor and perform in public. With a
                sudden horror, he realized - even as he and his radiant bride went to the center of the room - that he
                had forgotten everything Lelldorin had taught him.
            </p>
            <p>The dance which was popular at that particular season in the courts of the south was graceful and quite
                intricate. The partners were to face in the same direction, the man behind and slightly to one side of
                the woman. Their arms were supposed to be extended and their hands joined. Garion managed that part
                without too much trouble. It was all those quick, tiny little steps in time to the music that had him
                worried.
            </p>
            <p>In spite of everything, though, he did quite well. The fragrance of Ce'Nedra's hair, however, continued
                to work on him, and he noted that his hands trembled visibly as the two of them danced. At the end of
                the first melody, the wedding guests applauded enthusiastically; as the orchestra took up the second
                tune, they all joined in, and the floor was filled with whirling colors as the dance became general.
            </p>
            <p>"I guess we didn't do too badly," Garion murmured.</p>
            <p>"We were just fine," Ce'Nedra assured him.</p>
            <p>They continued to dance.</p>
            <p>"Garion," she said after a few moments.</p>
            <p>"Yes?"</p>
            <p>"Do you really love me?"</p>
            <p>"Of course I do. What a silly thing to ask."</p>
            <p>"Silly?"</p>
            <p>"Wrong word," he amended quickly. "Sorry."</p>
            <p>"Garion," she said after a few more measures.</p>
            <p>"Yes?"</p>
            <p>"I love you too, you know."</p>
            <p>"Of course I know."</p>
            <p>"Of course? Aren't you taking a bit much for granted?"</p>
            <p>"Why are we arguing?" he asked rather plaintively.</p>
            <p>"We aren't arguing, Garion," she told him loftily. "We're discussing."</p>
            <p>"Oh," he said. "That's all right then."</p>
            <p>As was expected, the royal couple danced with everyone. Ce'Nedra was passed from king to king like some
                royal prize, and Garion escorted queens and ladies alike to the center of the floor for the obligatory
                few measures. Tiny blond Queen Porenn of Drasnia gave him excellent advice, as did the stately Queen
                Islena of Cherek. Plump little Queen Layla was motherly - even a bit giddy. Queen Silar gravely
                congratulated him, and Mayaserana of Arendia suggested that he'd dance better if he weren't quite so
                stiff. Barak's wife, Merel, dressed in rich green brocade, gave him the best advice of all.
            </p>
            <p>"You'll fight with each other, of course," she told him as they danced, "but never go to sleep angry.
                That was always my mistake."
            </p>
            <p>And finally Garion danced with his cousin Adara.</p>
            <p>"Are you happy?" he asked her.</p>
            <p>"More than you could ever imagine," she replied with a gentle smile.</p>
            <p>"Then everything worked out for the best, didn't it?"</p>
            <p>"Yes, Garion. It's as if it had all been fated to happen. Everything feels so right, somehow."</p>
            <p>"It's possible that it was fated," Garion mused. "I sometimes think we have very little control over our
                own lives - I know I don't."
            </p>
            <p>She smiled. "Very deep thoughts for a bridegroom on his wedding day." Then her face grew gravely serious.
                "Don't let Ce'Nedra drive you to distraction," she advised. "And don't always give in to her."
            </p>
            <p>"You've heard about what's been happening?"</p>
            <p>She nodded. "Don't take it too seriously, Garion. She's been testing you, that's all."</p>
            <p>"Are you trying to say that I still have to prove something?"</p>
            <p>"With Ce'Nedra - probably every day. I know your little princess, Garion. All she really wants is for you
                to prove that you love her - and don't be afraid to say it to her. I think you'll be surprised at how
                agreeable she'll be if you just take the trouble to tell her that you love her - frequently."
            </p>
            <p>"She knows that already."</p>
            <p>"But you have to tell her."</p>
            <p>"How often do you think I ought to say it?"</p>
            <p>"Oh, probably every hour or so."</p>
            <p>He was almost certain that she was joking.</p>
            <p>"I've noticed that Sendars are a reserved sort of people," she told him. "That isn't going to work with
                Ce'Nedra. You're going to have to put your upbringing aside and come right out and say it. It will be
                worth the trouble, believe me."
            </p>
            <p>"I'll try," he promised her.</p>
            <p>She laughed and lightly kissed his cheek. "Poor Garion," she said.</p>
            <p>"Why poor Garion?"</p>
            <p>"You still have so much to learn."</p>
            <p>The dance continued.</p>
            <p>Exhausted finally and famished by their efforts, Garion and his bride made their way to the groaning
                table and sat down to take their wedding supper. The supper was quite special. Two days before the
                wedding, Aunt Pol had calmly marched into the royal kitchen and had taken charge. As a result,
                everything was perfect. The smells from the heavily laden table were overwhelming. King Rhodar
                absolutely could not pass by without just one more nibble.
            </p>
            <p>The music and the dance continued, and Garion watched, relieved that he had escaped the floor. His eyes
                sought out old friends in the crowd. Barak, huge but strangely gentle, danced with Merel, his wife. They
                looked very good together. Lelldorin danced with Ariana, and their eyes were lost in each others' faces.
            </p>
            <p>Relg and Taiba did not dance, but sat together in a secluded corner. They were, Garion noted, holding
                hands. Relg's expression was still slightly startled, but he did not look unhappy.
            </p>
            <p>Near the center of the floor, Hettar and Adara danced with the innate grace of those who spend their
                lives on horseback. Hettar's hawklike face was different somehow, and Adara was flushed with happiness.
            </p>
            <p>Garion decided that it might be a good time to try Adara's advice. He leaned toward Ce'Nedra's pink
                little ear and cleared his throat. "I love you," he whispered. It was difficult the first time, so he
                tried it again - just to get the feel of it. "I love you," he whispered again. It was easier the second
                time.
            </p>
            <p>The effect on his princess was electrifying. She blushed a sudden rosy red, and her eyes went very wide
                and somehow defenseless. Her entire heart seemed to be in those eyes. She appeared unable to speak, but
                reached out instead gently to touch his face. As he returned her gaze, he was quite amazed at the change
                that the simple phrase had made in her. Adara, it appeared, had been right. He stored that bit of
                information away rather carefully, feeling more confident than he had in months.
            </p>
            <p>The hall was filled with colors as the guests danced in celebration of the royal wedding. There were,
                however, a few faces that did not reflect the general happiness. Near the center of the floor,
                Mandorallen danced with the Lady Nerina, Baroness of Vo Ebor, and their faces mirrored that tragedy
                which was still central to their lives. Not far from them, Silk danced with Queen Porenn. The little
                man's face bore once again that same bitter, self mocking expression Garian had first seen in King
                Anheg's palace in Val Alorn.
            </p>
            <p>Garion sighed.</p>
            <p>"Melancholy already, my husband?" Ce'Nedra asked him with a little twinkle. Once again, even as they sat,
                she ducked her head beneath his arm and drew it about her in that peculiar way of hers. She smelled very
                good, and he noted that she was very soft and warm.
            </p>
            <p>"I was just remembering a few things," he replied to her question.</p>
            <p>"Good. Try to get that all out of the way now. I wouldn't want it interfering later."</p>
            <p>Garion's face turned bright red, and Ce'Nedra laughed a wicked little laugh. "I think that perhaps later
                is not much further off," she said then. "You must dance with Lady Polgara, and I will dance with your
                grandfather. And then I think it will be time for us to retire. It's been a very full day."
            </p>
            <p>"I am a bit tired," Garion agreed.</p>
            <p>"Your day isn't over yet, Belgarion of Riva," she told him pointedly.</p>
            <p>Feeling a bit peculiar about it, Garion approached Aunt Pol where she and Durnik sat watching the
                dance.
            </p>
            <p>"Will you dance with me, Aunt Polgara?" he asked with a formal little bow.</p>
            <p>She looked at him a bit quizzically. "So you've finally admitted it," she said.</p>
            <p>"Admitted what?"</p>
            <p>"Who I really am."</p>
            <p>"I've known."</p>
            <p>"But you've never called me by my full name before, Garion," she pointed out, rising and gently smoothing
                back his hair. "I think it might be a rather significant step."
            </p>
            <p>They danced together in the glowing candlelight to the music of lutes and pipes. Polgara's steps were
                more measured and slow than the dance Lelldorin had so painstakingly taught to Garion. She had reached
                back, Garion realized, into the dim past, and she led him through the stately measures of a dance she
                had learned centuries before, during her sojourn with the Wacite Arends. Together they moved through the
                slow, graceful, and somehow melancholy measures of a dance which had vanished forever some twenty-five
                centuries before, to live on only in Polgara's memory.
            </p>
            <p>Ce'Nedra was blushing furiously when Belgarath returned her to Garion for their last dance. The old man
                grinned impishly, bowed to his daughter and took her hands to lead her as well. The four of them danced
                not far from each other, and Garion clearly heard his Aunt's question. "Have we done well, father?"
            </p>
            <p>Belgarath's smile was quite genuine. "Why yes, Polgara," he replied. "As a matter of fact, I think we've
                done very well indeed."
            </p>
            <p>"Then it was all worth it, wasn't it, father?"</p>
            <p>"Yes, Pol, it really was."</p>
            <p>They danced on.</p>
            <p>"What did he say to you?" Garion whispered to Ce'Nedra.</p>
            <p>She blushed. "Never mind. Maybe I'll tell you - later."</p>
            <p>There was that word again.</p>
            <p>The dance ended, and an expectant hush fell over the crowd. Ce'Nedra went to her father, kissed him
                lightly, and then returned. "Well?" she said to Garion.
            </p>
            <p>"Well what?"</p>
            <p>She laughed. "Oh, you're impossible." Then she took his hand and very firmly led him from the hall.</p>
            <p>It was quite late - perhaps two hours past midnight. Belgarath the Sorcerer was in a whimsical mood as he
                wandered about the deserted halls of the Rivan Citadel with a tankard in his hand. Belgarath had done a
                bit
            </p>
            <p>of celebrating, and he was feeling decidedly mellow - though not nearly as much as many of the other
                wedding guests, who had already mellowed themselves into insensibility.
            </p>
            <p>The old man stopped once to examine a guard who was snoring in a doorway, sprawled in a puddle of spilled
                ale. Then, humming rather tunelessly and adding a couple of skipping little dance steps as he proceeded
                down the hall, the white-bearded old sorcerer made his way in the general direction of the ballroom,
                where he was certain there was a bit of ale left.
            </p>
            <p>As he passed the Hall of the Rivan King, he noted that the door was ajar and that there was a light
                inside.
            </p>
            <p>Curious, he stuck his head through the doorway to see if anyone might be about. The Hall was deserted,
                and the light infusing it came from the Orb of Aldur, resting on the pommel of the sword of the Rivan
                King.
            </p>
            <p>"Oh," Belgarath said to the stone, "it's you." Then the old man walked a trifle unsteadily down the aisle
                to the foot of the dais. "Well, old friend," he said, squinting up at the Orb, "I see they've all gone
                off and left you alone too."
            </p>
            <p>The Orb flickered its recognition of him.</p>
            <p>Belgarath sat down heavily on the edge of the dais and took a drink of ale. "We've come a long way
                together, haven't we?" he said to the Orb in a conversational tone.
            </p>
            <p>The Orb ignored him.</p>
            <p>"I wish you weren't so serious about things all the time. You're a very stodgy companion." The old man
                took another drink.
            </p>
            <p>They were silent for a while, and Belgarath pulled off one of his boots, sighed and wriggled his toes
                contentedly.
            </p>
            <p>"You really don't understand any of this, do you, my friend?" he asked the Orb finally. "In spite of
                everything, you still have the soul of a stone. You understand hate and loyalty and unswerving
                commitment, but you can't comprehend the more human feelings - compassion, friendship, love - love most
                of all, I think. It's sort of a shame that you don't understand, really, because those were the things
                that finally decided all this. They've been mixed up in it from the very beginning - but then you
                wouldn't know about that, would you?"
            </p>
            <p>The Orb continued to ignore him, its attention obviously elsewhere. "What are you concentrating on so
                hard?" the old man asked curiously.
            </p>
            <p>The Orb, which had glowed with a bright blue radiance flickered again, and its blue became suddenly
                infused with a pale pink which steadily grew more and more pronounced until the stone was actually
                blushing.
            </p>
            <p>Belgarath cast one twinkling glance in the general direction of the royal apartment. "Oh," he said,
                understanding. Then he began to chuckle.
            </p>
            <p>The Orb blushed even brighter.</p>
            <p>Belgarath laughed, pulled his boot back on and rose unsteadily to his feet. "Perhaps you understand more
                than I thought you did," he said to the stone. He drained the last few drops from his tankard. "I'd
                really like to stay and discuss it," he said, "but I've run out of ale. I'm sure you'll excuse me."
            </p>
            <p>Then he went back up the broad aisle.</p>
            <p>When he reached the doorway, he stopped and cast one amused glance back at the still furiously blushing
                Orb. Then he chuckled again and went out, quietly closing the door behind him.
